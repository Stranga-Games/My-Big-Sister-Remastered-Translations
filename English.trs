A Bad Dream?

And just like that...

our lives changed, forever.

Is any of this real?

Do I need help?

I think I'm fine, there's nothing wrong with...me.
I think I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with...me.
It must be her fault! She did this to me!

Don't worry...

Heh, ya'know...

this is kinda fun!

We should do this more often...but it's a little late now.

It's creepy out there...

We're almost home.

I can feel it getting closer.

But...

what happens when we're there. 

Will everything go back to the way it was?

...

Well we go back to our seperate ways...
Well we go back to our separate ways...
will I...

lose my sister?

Wake up! Please! 

The tunnel of sorrows...

it brings out our worst fears, our saddest moments in life.

I didn't have the courage to tell her what I saw...

about what will happen.

It'll haunt me forever.

Will we ever make it back?

We're so close, yet, it seems so far. 
We're so close, yet it seems so far.
I just need to stay posotive. 
I just need to stay positive.

Well...this is it...

I'm glad we grew closer, together. 

We're all counting on you, Luzia.

W-What are you doing here?

I need your help, Luzia.

Not here! People will see you!

B-But I-

Just go away, Sombria! 

Luzia...

Just go!

Why can't she just leave me alone. 

*Sigh* I'm sorry, Sombria.

There's nothing I can do. 

I can't open it.

The lock's broken.

Hello!?

Is anyone in there!?

I guess not.

It's a poster for a cola company.

"Feel fresh! With our new buzz blast cola!"
"Feel fresh! With our new Buzz Blast Cola!"
The bottle's stuck between her boobs.

They're old animal cages.

Yuck! The smell! 

They must've dies in them...

Hey! What's that?

A key!

I can't reach it, my hands won't fit through the bars.
I can't reach it - my hands won't fit through the bars.
I could use somthing smaller and longer to rach them.

Aha! Gotcha!
CoatHanger

Now that's something I can use.
Now, that's something I can use.
A coat hanger.

There's nothing else useful in here.

It's pretty dark down there.

Wait!

There's something shining down there...

but I can't fit through the gap.

I need something long and wirey to reach it. 
I need something long and wiry to reach it.
Whoops! Almost dropped it!

I can use this to reach that shiny thing.

It's a small flashlight.

I'll hang onto it, could be useful. 
I'll hang onto it - could be useful.
I don't need this coat hanger anymore.

It's unlocked!

You can keep the chopsticks darling.

Thanks!

Mmmm...

That smells delicious!

Hello there, child. 

You seem lost?

Maybe, I don't know?

I fell asleep...

when I woke up I was here.

Do you need anything, my darling?

How about some of those tasty noodles!

I'm starving!

It's all yours.
They're all yours.
Here, try some.

Can you tell me where I am?

Huh? Oh, you're in the downtown marketplace.

Do you know how I can get home?

Where are your parents?

I-I'm not sure, I woke up here. 
I-I'm not sure. I woke up here.
Maybe you should just wait here.

I'm sure they'll return for you. 

Ok, thanks. 

Say, you haven't found a key, have you?

I dropped it around here somewhere.

Nope, sorry, Mister. 

Just wait here.

I'm sure they will find you.

It's an Air Duct.

Maybe I can crawl through. 

It's pretty dark in there, though.

I'll need some sort of light before I can go in there.

Ok, that's better. 

I hope this is the way home.

Yes?

I found your key, Mister!

You look like a creepy doll!

Yeah, but you can still cuddle a doll.

I wouldn't want to cuddle a zombie. 

*Sigh* Look, why can't you sleep?

I had that dream again?

Again? Which one?

The one where you were stuck in that marketplace...

What about that German singing alligator one?

*Sigh* Please...

I was trying to forget about that one, that damed song. 

Nope, definately the marketplace one. 
Nope, definitely the marketplace one.
You mean the one where I'm like this "ghost-like" thing? 

Yep! 

Doesn't that bother you at all?

Why? It's your dream, after all.

But you're dead. 

It's just a dream Luzia.
It's just a dream, Luzia.
Whatever you say, Sombie...

just don't say I didn't warn you. 

You worry too much, besides...
You worry too much. Besides...

Perfect! 

Now I can't get back to sleep! 

Better see what Sombie's up to. 

Hopefully, I can go back to sleep.

Ok...

this is not working! 

WHY CAN'T I SLEEP?!

Oh, yeah! The lights! 

Better turn them off. 

Like duh. 

That was quick, I didn't even leave the bed.

Maybe a fuse or something? 

*Sigh* I'm gonna get in trouble for this, but...

MOM! MOMMY! THE LIGHT'S BLEW UP! 

M-Mom?

I bet Sombie's just tryin' to scare me again. 

SOMBIE! YOU'RE GONNA GET IT!

Fine, I guess I'll just go and fix the lights myself!

I can't sleep.

Even just peeking in. 

Besides, it's locked

Well, just a peek. She's not gonna mind.

Yuck! Smells like cigarettes!

I don't need to go to the bathroom.

Gee, I wonder why "assface" gets to stay up so late.

She doesn't even do anything besides stink up the place and be annoying! 

Maybe I should tell Mom that she's smoking?

Hmm, probably a bad idea, she'd probably tell Mom about my pet roach.

Sombria, what happened?

RUN LUZIA! RUN!

Oh no!

So, Luzia...

what are we going to talk about today?

*Shrugs* I dunno.

How about we start with these reoccurring dreams?
How about we start with these recurring dreams?
Would you like to talk to me about the last one you had?

No.

Luzia, how can I help you if you're not going to open up to me?

Can I ask you something?

You can ask me anything, Luzia. 

You were diagnosed with a rare but bizarre mental illness, Luzia. That's why you're-

Why am I really here?

All you want to talk about are my dreams...

maybe, it's not the dreams or the illness...
maybe it's not the dreams or the illness...
maybe, it's me.
maybe it's me.
Your dreams drive your illness, Luzia.

I think your sister's death is the key to your problem. 

Sombie's not dead, though.

Luzia, we've been through this. She's dead, you must accept it. 
Luzia, we've been through this. She's dead. You must accept it.
We need to make some sort of progress if we're going to make you feel better.

F-Fine, I'll accept it then.

Good, we finally made some progress. 

You've finally come to accept your sister's- 

Because they don't help, they make me forget about things.

No, I accept that she is still alive. 

We may have to reduce your dosage, you could be having hallucinations. 
We may have to reduce your dosage - you could be having hallucinations.
I'll prescribe you with something a little less-

I haven't been taking them...

for weeks now.

W-Why not?

She is alive, it's true.

Luzia, this may be hard for you to understand, but it was you who found her body...

hanging, in her room. 

You're lying! 

The thing is...

It's ok, Luzia. It's-

Do you believe in the afterlife, Mr. Black?

Hmm, what do you mean by that, Luzia?

Like, ghosts, spirits? 

Kinda.

Ghosts can't touch you...hurt you.

A poltergeist, maybe? 

I don't know...

do poltergeist eat?
do poltergeists eat?
I don't see the need if they're already spirits of the dead.

Then why does Sombie eat?

Because she eats, a lot!

And just what does she eat, Luzia?

Noodles!

Oh?

Oh, and people!

People? 

Sometimes...

only when she's mad. 

Well, that settles it. I think you're going to have to start taking your medication again.

Trust me, it'll help you, I promise. 

It doesn't help, it makes things worse. I can't even remember the last time I saw you. 
It doesn't help - it makes things worse. I can't even remember the last time I saw you.
L-Let's try something, Luzia.

An exercise, I want you to find something in this room, any object.
An exercise: I want you to find something in this room, any object.
It has to relate to how you feel right now. 

Pick anything you want in this room and bring it to me. 

I'll assess you afterwards. 

Please, just be careful with the items...

I want to keep everything in one piece.

OK.

There's nothing here.

Ick, a brain... 

I better take this, he'll think I'm smart or something. 

Hey! A Doll!

Maybe it's just me...

but dolls creep me the heck out! 

So you brought me the doll.

Let's talk about that.

Please, take a seat.

So, why did you pick the doll?

It's cute I guess?

In a creepy sorta way. 

Hmm, I can assure you it means more than just "cute".
Hmm, I can assure you it means more than just "cute."
This to me, means vulnerability... 
This, to me, means vulnerability...
are you feeling fragile, Luzia?

Fragile? What's that supposed to mean?

Did your sister ever "hurt" you, or "touch" you in any wa-
Did your sister ever "hurt" you or "touch" you in any wa-
What?! No! 

They would never do such a thing!
She would never do such a thing!
Besides, mom's never home, she's always working. 
Besides, Mom's never home, she's always working.
She's a nurse, so she works late. 

What about your father?

I told you before, I don't have one. 

It's always been just me, Sombie and my mom. 

Well, Luzia, you did pick the doll. 

I picked it because it was cute. I like dolls! 

I'm not vulnerable, at least...I don't think I am?

You're holding back, Luzia. 

It's ok to tell me, I want to help you. 
It's ok to tell me. I want to help you.
*Sigh* There is one thing...

but I really don't like to talk about it.

My sister did-

Touch you? I knew it! 

Finally! A breakthrou-

No, she didn't "touch" me, she...

did hurt me. 

This is still a breakthrough! How did she hurt you?

She...she said I was adopted. That we're not really sisters...

and mom is not really my mom.

Is that all?!

Huh? What do you mean, is that all?

If Sombie was here right now she'd be eating you so fast-

Luzia, I think we're done here today. 

Sombie! Show him! Please! 

I'll have the receptionist book your next appointment and please, take your medication. 

See the lady at the desk on your way out.

ACH_DOLL

Hmm, the brain.

Interesting. 

Why did you pick this?

Because I'm smart! 

It's also all pink and squishy! 

To me it means intellectuality. 

You seem like a smart girl, Luzia. 

Sombie thought so too...

a "smart ass".
a "smartass."
*I can see why*

Tell me something, if you're a smart girl...

why do you still insist your sister is still alive?

I-I...

look, I don't want to talk about her anymore. 

We still have another twenty minutes left, Luzia. 

I said, no more. 

Don't do this again, don't waste my time, Luzia.
Don't do this again. Don't waste my time, Luzia.
Remember what happened the last time you did?

*yes, I remember*

Now, can we please get back to your sister-

You can't do that to me anymore. 

D-Do what, Luzia?

Hurt me...

W-What are you talking about? I don't hurt-

touch me

How dare you! I would never-

The medication helps me forget...remember?

L-Luzia? What's happened to your voice?

I don't think he get's it, Luzia. 

I think it's time we show him... 

what it means to feel "alive".
what it means to feel "alive."
G-Get the hell away from me! 

I'm sorry, Mr. Black...

I really am.

W-What's that sound?

WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?!

W_WHAT IS THAT THING! 

That? 

That is Sombria. 

IMPOSSIBLE! 

Told ya so! 

STAY AWAY, PLEASE!

See, she's alive. 

Now do you believe me?

Well? W-Wait! Sombie! 

NO! STAY AWAY!

Sombie! What the heck?! I only meant scare him! 

You may as well lick the chair clean, now.

There's blood everywhere! 

Hee wass hurrrrtinnnng youuu, Luzzzzia. 

Please don't put the voice on, it's stupid. 

You're not scary, Sombie. 

Sorry, but I can't stand it! This body aches, I'm always hungry, and the pain...is excruciating! 

I can't live like this.

You're fine, Sombie.

Don't put yourself down.

I'm a fucking hideous creature!

Do I look fine to you? I'm a hideous creature! 

I don't know if I'm dead or alive?

Well, at least you're out of your room finally.
Well, at least you're out of your room, finally.
THIS ISN'T FUNNY! 

Well, it's better than being depressed?

You wouldn't know a thing about being depressed, Luzia! 

Y-You're right, I-I'm sorry, Sombie.

I want to help you. 

You can't, Luzia...

no one can.

Well, I'm here if you want any help.

That's what sisters are for.

Wow Luzia, I can't believe you just said that.

Thanks.

It's okay.

Let's go home.

Just like everyone else.

I've got some issues I need sorting.

What about you darling?
What about you, darling?
Taking your sister out for lunch?

Don't you have noodles to sell or something?

Don't you have a sister that needs you?
Don't you have a sister who needs you?
There's nothing else I can do for her. 

She doesn't want my help, anyway. 

That's what they all say.

What do you mean?

Do you think she want's you to ask you for your help?
Do you think she wants you to ask her for your help?

But you said it yourself...

she can't be changed back.

That doesn't mean she can't be helped...

Then tell me how you would feel?

That word Sombie said before...

depressed.

Gosh!

I don't know why you're seeing this fool! 

I should start my own clinic, and get out of noodles.
I should start my own clinic and get out of noodles.
Is there a way to get out of here?

I need to help Sombria.

You're twelve, you're better figuring this out than me! 

You're better figuring this stuff out than me.

Besides, the key to your problem is better off flushed away.

Great, now I can get outta here.

Feeling sick my darling?

You took your time in there.

I-It must have been something I ate for lunch.

Okay dear, see you next time.

I hope I don't see "you" anymore.

It's just a bunch of brochures for holiday parks.

He think's I'm crazy! 

It's not all just about you, ya'know-

I should have been the one that was cursed. 

Well, it's too late, little sister. 

You can't change your mistakes.

...she's right. 

She's getting worse by the day...

and I keep making it worse...

don't worry, Sombria.

I will fix this, I promise. 

Is that the door?

So, where are we going?

I don't know, Luzia! 

Stop asking me! 

How can you be so calm about this?!

Easy, this has to be a prank!

A prank? You think this is a prank, Luzia?!

WE'RE BEING KIDNAPPED! 

When is that going to sink into that stupid little head of yours?!

Well, what are we going to do about it, then?

The door's locked...

there's no way out. 

Yep, we're screwed. 

Still so chirpy, I don't get you at all. 
Still so chirpy. I don't get you at all.
Only thing to do is see where they take us. 

Who's they?

I don't know, they were wearing masks.

I thought I saw...

an old-

Hey! Do you hear that?

It sounds like a parade?

Where are we?

It sounds like...

Little Asia!

Little Asia?

Yeah, I can hear the Asian music! 

Weird thing is we don't have any Asian towns near us?

So, I'm stumped!

I don't know. 

Anyway, we need a plan for when that door opens.

I'll kick the guy that opens it and then we make a run for it, ok?

That's a stupid plan, it'll never work. 

Oh, and why not?

Well, in the movies...

the kidnapped people usually fall asleep before they arrive.

In the movies?

Yes, the movies. 

You think this is a movie?!

*Sigh* It'll work, trust me. 

If you say so, sis. 
If you say so, Sis.
Okay, let's get ready.

Hopefully, we'll be arriving soon. 

FirstEnter

Well...

it's about time you showed up. 

You girls have a smooth ride here?

I deeply apologize for the rough transportation... 

and I guess you both are wanting an explanation for all of-

Why are you naked?

Naked? Why, aren't you the mischievous one.

Welcome, to my bathhouse. 

We're fine, thanks. 

I wanna go swimming! 

Shut up, Luzia! Now is definitely not the time to go-

Oh, but where are my manners. 

I am Ashina... 

but everyone just calls me "The Red Witch".

A witch?

Like, pointy hat, warts and, black cats?

Heh, sort of.

Your Luzia, right?

I've heard a lot about you, we're not so different you and I. 

What do you want with us?

Why did you bring us here?

Skipping introductions? 

Very well. 

I only wanted you, Sombria...

your sister wasn't part of the plan. 

What! Why!?

Thing is, you have something that I want, that I need. 

You see, when we can't have what we want in life, we take it.  

And all I wanted was a pair of legs...

long, luscious, beautiful legs. 

To attract the man of my dreams.

I couldn't have what I wanted...

well, not in this world. 

To get what I desired was to make a sacrifice...

I took the legs from my sister, ripped them off of her waist! 

She had all the perfections any girl would ever dream of! 

I finally got what I wanted...

but at a cost.

This, this is my prize for my sacrifice! 

As you can see...

this is my curse. 

No way!

W-What do you want with me?

We look very much alike, you and I.

It's uncanny how much we resemble one another...

we are almost, identical.
we are almost identical.
I would like to offer you a trade...

my body, for yours.

W-What?! No! 

This all could be yours, the bathhouse, the fame, the riches...all of it. Anything you wish.  
This all could be yours: the bathhouse, the fame, the riches...all of it. Anything you wish.
She ain't geting your stilts lady!
She ain't getting your stilts, lady!
You better let us go-

Wait, did you say "anything"?

LUZIA!

Sombie, ask for a pony, quickly! 

just ask for a really tall one! 

Ha Ha! Sombria, I love your little sister!
Ha ha! Sombria, I love your little sister!
What a sense of humor! 

LUZIA, STOP IT!

Ok, then forget about it, lady! 

Heh, it was just an offer, sweetie. 

You're more than welcome to decline, Sombria. 

Then why did you kidnap us?

Funny, I don't remember asking for you to be kidnapped?

I'll make sure to punish whoever did that to you. 

Oh, and Sombria...

think about my offer. 

I don't want to think about it!

I just want us to go home!

Then, let's got you both home.
Then, let's get you both home.
I'll arrange a ride back for both of you, but in the mean time...

feel free to enjoy the buffet. You must be hungry.
You got a buffet?!

All you can eat.

Ok, I'm sold.

C'mon, Sombie! Let's go chow down! 

If only you girls knew...

Did I say you could come in? 

Surely a mother can visit her favorite daughter?

You are no mother of mine, you old hag!

You gave me this wretched curse, and destroyed Tena's-

And you took my daughters for greed over some stupid man. 

…why are you here?

Just a friendly word of caution.

What?

Beware of the child. 

She bares the mark of Roh-

I know who she is! 

She's too innocent to cause any trouble. 

ACH_JUST_A_LITTLE_GIRL

Her innocence is her specialty, my daughter. 

Funny, I thought she died. 

Well, you thought wrong, you old crone. 

Once I have Sombria's body, your wretched curse will be no more!  

I will finally be free.

*Tisk, tisk* My poor daughter, I'm sorry...
*Tsk, tsk* My poor daughter, I'm sorry...
but you will never be free, just like your friend, Tanto.

Not now, Luzia.

I think you're lying. 

You don't have a face, do you? 

Do I need one? 

I'm not even human.

Kid, you ask way too many questions. 

Well, how about one more?

Can I have that big, sharp knife?

Oh, right, no. It's mine
Oh, right, no. It's mine.
Can't have everything we want, sorry. 

Just like me. 

Well, what do you want? A face?

I wouldn't say no to one, could use a face lift. 

Hey! Mr. Butcher!

I have a surprise for you!

I found you a face!

Really? Who'd you steal it off? 

You didn't cut someone's face-

Ta da!

Oh...a mask. 

So, what do you think?

Honestly, it doesn't look half bad!

Thanks kid!

So, can I have that knife now.
So, can I have that knife now?
Sure, go nuts! 

Just be responsible with it...

you don't wanna go round killin' anyone with it or anything. 

Can you tell me a little more about this item?

Uh, I already know that.

Woah! Is death painful?

Is death painful?

Apart from them being very useful with cooking and eating, they are basically just to sticks.

Wait, he's alive?!

HAMAMNPH-Ah! Finally! 

I've been trying to pry open her lips so I can talk...

and now that I can...

WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT FOR!!?

I can't believe you're still alive!

As I said be for, I'm already dead! 
As I said before, I'm already dead!
NOW I'M JUST A HEAD! YOU LITTLE DIP-

Sorry about that, but what the hell happened here?

*Sigh* She did this... 

the lady who's not so on the wall. 

She broke free. 

How? 

Listen kid, there's no time to waste...

she's after someone named Sombria. 

That's my sister!

Find her and get out while you still can! 

She will kill you both if you stay here. 

But I need that head you're wearing!

Listen kid, just get out! She is coming for you! 

Look, I'm going to find Sombria...

just hang in there, and try not to lose your head- I mean her head! 

What is that? Some kind of headless joke?

Oh! A candy bar!

I don't smell that bad, do I?
It's a sauna.

I can't see through the glass. 

It's locked but...

There's something shiny in there.

If only I had someway of picking the lock?

There's nothing else in here.

Okay, this should work.

There! I got it!

Hey! What's this? 

A mask?

It looks kinda creepy.

Sombie! Where the hell have you been!?

I was looking everywhere for you!

Luzia, there's no time.

I need you to stand in the other circle now!

Why? What's going on?

You need to do exactly what I tell you.

Go now!

You need to cut your hand and draw blood! 

Spill it in the circle! 

ARE YOU INSANE!?

She's attracted to blood!

WHY DO WE WANT TO ATTRACT HER FOR!?

SHE IS GOING TO EAT US!

Luzia, you need to trust me!

Use something to cut yourself!

Oh, hiding in the sauna, are we?
I'm surprised you can fit in there with those long legs!

Wait! WHAT IS THIS?!

I can hear talking out there.

I-It's Luzia.

Hmm, strange name for a young girl.

My Mom said it's a "bright" name.

Such a dark place to be in for one with such a..."bright" name. 

Tell me Luzia, why are you here?
Tell me, Luzia, why are you here?
We were kidnapped by the witch in the bath and-

We?

There's someone with you?

Yeah, my sister, Sombria.

Heh...

How ironic, the opposites. Light and Dark. 

Tell me, did the witch make either of you an offer?

Well, not to me...

she did to Sombie though. 

I knew it! Trying to escape your wretched curse now, are you?

I don't think so, we're just waiting for our ride home.
I don't think so. We're just waiting for our ride home.
She's not letting you leave, Luzia...

but I may be able to help you, both. 

Okay, how?

I'll make you a deal...

You bring me something that I wan't. and I'll tell you how to escape, deal?

Okay, that sounds fair.

However, if you bring me something that I don't want...

then you will nourish my withing body with yours, deal?
then you will nourish my withering body with yours, deal?
Wait, what?! No way, lady! 

I could just eat you now? Save me the rouble of waiting.

Death.

Oh, would you look at that!

Such a lifeless, greasy body. A dead fish...

Looks like you made the right choice. 

I shall help you, but just this once. 

You need to find the secret passage somewhere in the bathing room.

You'll need this tile plus one other to activate the passage.

You should hurry if you want to save your sister...

and...I'm also getting quite hungry.

*Tisk,tisk* You dissapoint me, Luzia. 
*Tsk, tsk* You disappoint me, Luzia.
But you won't dissapoint me stomach.

I think it's in the secret bathroom.

You're not going anywhere. 

I need you both for my plan of redemption! 

I'm not leaving without my sister!

Luzia, I love your bravery.

But seriously, what are you going to do?

Something you wouldn't like.

Maybe something like this?

*Gasp* SOMBRIA!!!

Whoops, sorry Luzia.
Whoops, sorry, Luzia.
But she's mine now.

WHAT DID YOU DO TO SOMBRIA!

Something that was done to me, a long time ago.

I will fuse my spirit with hers and leave this forsaken world! 

You will stay here with the others. 

CHANGE HER BACK!

There's no going back! I am tired of having to live in those cold salty waters for too long! 

She is no longer your sister, Luzia!

You're wrong...

Luzia! Hurry!

We can escape through this pipe in the water.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

Please, just don't say anything right now...

leave me alone. 

You always want to be left alone. 

Because I can never be alone when you're around! 

Why is this happening to me?

What did I do to deserve this?

This must be the way out of here.

But it's locked.

I'll have to find a key.

Just because I'm dry, doesn't mean I want to jump back in.

More dead animal cages floating in there. 

There's a door on the other side.

I don't think I can jump that gap. 

Maybe, I could make a bridge.

I hope this holds.

I don't want to get wet again.

Eww gross!

I'll need to fish it out somehow.

Hopefully that shiny thing is made out of metal.

I could use this plank of wood to make a bridge. 

It looks pretty old though.

how are we going to change me back?

Sorry, little one. I'm really busy with this mess.

I think my sister is cursed.

Hmm, you should find Yoko. 

She's an expert on such things. 

Yoko?

Where can I find her?

Well, my friend usually sees her in the laundromat, washing her blankets. 

But for some reason, some wise-ass locked the gate to the laundromat and has the key.

That sounds more like a curse to me.

I thought so. 

You didn't meet a witch by chance? Did you?

Maybe.

Well, the only person I know that could help you is Yoko. 

She's also known as the "Noodle Lady".

give me the fish and I'll show you just how little I can eat-

Maybe you should eat some fruit for once! Much healthier! 

Now that you mention it, I could go for an apple right about now. 

I'll tell you what, you find me an apple and I'll give you the gate key to the laundromat, deal?

must be Tuesday.

Oh? You girls are back?

Well with the Lady running around, I was sure you'd be done for.

C'mon, don't bullshit me, old lady!

Ouch.

Screw you, Luzia! You're the real monster!

Shut up, Luzia! You're the real monster!

Oh how I've missed this.

How could you miss this? 

I have to live with this little brat every day! 

I look like a freak because of her! 

I still remember when my daughters used to get along so well.

All they ever do now is fight for centuries...

just like you two. 

Wait! Centuries?

How old are you?

How old do you think I am, Luzia? 

A hundred, maybe?

Huh, must be the hair.

Eighty? 

You can keep guessing, you'll never get it. 

How can the witch- I mean, your daughter, look as old as me?

We're in the spirit world, young lady. 

Age means nothing here. 

So we don't age?

C-Can we fix my condition, first?

Yes, of course.

Now that we have my daughter's head...

I can use her blood to make a cure for the curse. 

All you need to do is drink it.

It'll take some time to work but once it does, it should change you back to your old self.

You mean Sombie, right?

S-Sure. 

Just remember...

that when the time comes, you will have to make a choice. 

Just tell me what I have to do.

Heh, just drink this and go home.

That is all.

Wait, really?

That's it?

No magic spells, voodoo or rituals?

I can assure you that it is much more complicated behind the veil.

Once you both return home...

it shall be broken.

So how do we get home?

We were kidnapped in the back of a truck!

I have no idea where we are or what this "spirit place" is?

I have a few tricks up my sleeve and a few favors that need to be repaid. 

I can arrange travel as far as the country side but from there you will need to return on your own.
I can arrange travel as far as the countryside, but from there, you will need to return on your own.

I am Yokona Kagami...

but everyone just calls me the "Noodle Lady"

Let me guess, it's because you sell noodles?

I own the Ramen shop next door. 

I see you both have met my daughter, Ashina.

Mommy long legs is your daughter?!

This is perfect! You can help Sombie! 

Right?

Hmm, by the looks of things it may be too late for her, Luzia. 

You mean I'll be stuck like this forever?

My dear, I hate to be the one to tell you this but, you're dead. 

I'M DEAD?!

But she's standing right there! 

Sombria, place your hand over your heart.

Do you feel a beat?

THERE'S NO BEAT! I'M DEAD!!

WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO ME?!

Well, you're now one of us, Sombria. A yokai. 

A what?

A yokai, a ghost, spirit, whatever you want to call it...

well actually, maybe poltergeist is probably a better term. 

It seems Ashina wanted something from you but what exactly?

S-She wanted to swap her body with mine...

to remove her curse.

Hmm, looks like it didn't go all to plan. 

Something went wrong as you've turned into one of us. 

One of you? You still look human! 

I look like a hideous, monstrous creature! 

You just look like a human, only with long arms and pale skin.

And no legs, what happened to those?

Anyway, you look fine, Sombie. 

Where is Ashina now?

She's dead, I think.

Her head was floating in the bath.

Dead?! Ha! Serves her right! 

Wow really? I'd really hate to have you as a mom. 

I think Sombie killed her. 

Well this is certainly some good news! 

Good news?

We may be able to reverse the curse.

Reverse the curse? How?

All we need is some of Ashina's blood. 

So if you both are able to retrieve her head then-

Um, how about NO!

I never want to set a foot back in that place.

Don't you want to help your sister?

I do, but isn't there another way?

I'll go.

Wait, Sombie...

You've done enough, Luzia. 

I need to fix this myself. 

I love it when sisters squabble.

Don't you, Luzia?

Yeah, whoopie. 

What are you waiting for?

Go after her.

She obviously doesn't want my help.

They never do...

so why wait for an invitation?

Huh, you're right, old noodle lady. 

Besides, I've probably pissed her off enough for one day. 

Here's the spare key to the bathhouse, I keep it incase of emergencies. 
Here's the spare key to the bathhouse. I keep it in case of emergencies.

Good luck, little one. You're gonna need it. 

So explain to me again...

why are we riding with the door open? Isn't it a little dangerous?

Just look at that view! 

The never ending line of fences, the trees, the fresh air...
The never-ending line of fences, the trees, the fresh air...
it's breathtaking. 

It's nauseating, I think I'm gonna *ugh*...
It's nauseating. I think I'm gonna *ugh*...
the smell of cows isn't helping. 

Ha! They smell better than you right now!

*Sniff* I don't notice anything? 

Pfft! You can't smell yourself, dummy. It's a proven fact! 

No it isn't.

Then how come you can't smell your own farts?

You're an idiot.

It's true!

Everybody else can smell mine, except me.

That's because you leave the room right after you do one!

Nah, I think it's fart magic.

Speaking of magic...

did you take that magic potion?

It's not a magic potion, it's an antidote...

and yes I did. 

I would have taken it when I got home.

Didn't the old noodle lady said it would go off in a few days?

Yes but it shouldn't take us that long to get home, I think?

Two days. I remember her saying something about that this morning...

and some mumbo jumbo about breaking the "loop".
and some mumbo jumbo about breaking the "loop."
Loop? What loop?

Loop of the curse, I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. 

Actually, there was one thing she did say before we left. 

T-That I should...

*ugh* enjoy my time with you. 

Ha! That's easy! What's not to enjoy? 

I'm always fun, baby! 

Whatever. 

And I'm smoke free! 

Rubbing it in, huh? 

You know what? We're not fighting, right now. 

she was right.

This is kinda enjoyable.

*Deep breath* I can't get enough of that stank, cow fart infested air! 

Annnd there it goes. Enjoyment gone. 

I have to say, you're one weird girl, Luzia. 

So much for the truck ride.

Just be thankful it got us this far. 

Where are we anyway?
Where are we, anyway?
It looks like a bus stop. 

Congratulations, Luzia...

you won a cookie. 

Wait, really? 

Gimme! I'm starving! 

All I ate was a dead fish I found in the buffet! 

Please tell me that didn't happen?

I stole it from that faceless guy. 

I can't believe we're even related.

I was being sarcastic about the cookie, Luzia. 

Damn.

This bus sure is slow.

Well, I'm bored. 

Oh no, you're not wandering off again!

Please?

The last time you wondered off I turned into this hideous creature!
The last time you wandered off I turned into this hideous creature!
Do you really think I'm going to let that happen again?

This time, you stay here...

I'm gonna go see if I can find someone  around here, maybe they'll have some food...I'm hungry too. 

You too?!

J-Just wait here, I can smell something...
J-Just wait here. I can smell something...
Call out when the bus arrives. 

Huh, so this is what it feels like. 

Hey! A mushroom! 

I could eat it.

If I were desperate, looks poisonous.
If I were desperate. Looks poisonous.

I hope this helps her.

Here you go, Sombie. 

This'll keep you dry. 

Please tell me you didn't just do that.

A leaf? This is going to keep me dry?

I feel silly.

You look silly. 

So, find anything in there?

Nothing out of the ordinary.

After everything we've seen, what's ordinary anymore? 

We should probably stand under the bus shelter.

I like the rain.

It's nice.

It is peaceful, but we're probably gonna catch a cold.

what will happen with us, when this is all over?
what will happen with us when this is all over?
I, I don't know...

it'll all go back to normal, I guess. 

Even us?

The fighting, the arguing, stuff like that?

Oh! Well, we don't have to...

it all depends. 

On what?

On how much you owe me after this.

I have a feeling that I'm never gonna hear the end of this once we get home. 

Oh, you better believe it sister. 

Fantastic! 

Yep! I'm gonna remind you all the time, about how you saved my life.
Yep! I'm gonna remind you all the time about how you saved my life.
So, you're not mad at me anymore?

I was never mad at you, Luzia.

Once you get older things become more complicated...

sometimes, I wish I could be as young as you again. 

We can't go back...

we need to keep moving forward...

and if I stay mad at you...

I won't be going anywhere. 

I get what you mean. 

W-Well, good! 

Just promise me one thing. 

Please, quit smoking. You're stinking up the whole house! 

Heh, we'll see, Luzia.

You do?

I swear we haven't met.

We didn't have to, I just know. 
We didn't have to. I just know.
Why have you come here, young Luzia?

Because I'm hungry.

Besides that, I mean why are you really here. 

We're stuck while wating for the bus to take us home...

but I'm still hungry. 

The why is your sister here?

How do you-

I am Wiji! 

I am the spirit of the forest!

Again?

What do you mean again?

Hmm, it seems like you have forgotten...

such a strange anomaly. 

Tell me, are you planning on breaking your "loop"?

Enough with this loop business! 

First, the noodle lady, now Sombri-

Yes, the old woman. I can't seem to remember her name though.

Yoko, something. 

Yokona Kagami. 

Yeah that's it!

Seems like their plan didn't work after all. 

Young Luzia, you must listen to me very carefully...

when the time comes to end it all, you will find what alters your fate in beneath the dirt and soil. 

Wait, what does that mean? I'm gonna die?! 

We will see, young Luzia. Good luck. 

Wait, before I go...

why does everyone loves noodles so much?

Whatever happened to aunt Claire and cousin Mark?

She dies, Luzia. Mark, I have no clue, to be honest with you. I think he went to a foster home. 

Really? Why didn't he come live with us?

You're already a handful.

Besides, I think it's for the best...

You best be gettin' back to your cabin young missy.
You best be gettin' back to your cabin, young missy.
Once we enter the tunnel of sorrows, you don't wanna be wonderin' around.
Once we enter the tunnel of sorrows, you don't wanna be wanderin' around.
But come see me later! If you're still alive, that is!

Alive?

H-hey, are you okay?

What home...

Our home.

We don't have a home, Luzia.

Of course we do!

Please don't give up on me now!

Luzia, answer me something.

What do you remember about mother?

Well, not much.

She was never around.

I guess she was too busy working at the hospital.

Luzia...we don't have a mother.

W-what do you mean?

S-She died over a year ago.

I've been lying about her coming home late.

That's the reason I've been sending you to bed early.

B-But her car?!

I hear her pull up every night!

That was my boyfriend.

I've been lying to you for all these years.

I don't know who to trust anymore.

For the first time in my life...

...I feel empty.

Luzia...I-I...

Little one!

Come here quick!

Stop listening to the lies!

Lies?

Sorry little one!
Sorry, little one!
But I could not help over hearing your conversation.
But I could not help overhearing your conversation.
What's it matter anyway...
What's it matter, anyway...
You don't believe that garbage do you?!
You don't believe that garbage, do you?!
What did I say earlier? Hmm?

U-Uh...I forgot.

Well at least we're out the other end.

End of what?

Ho Ho! The tunnel!

I see the tunnel of sorrows has affected your mind somehow?

The tunnel of sorrows?

When the train passes through the tunnel your worst doubts emerge.
When the train passes through the tunnel, your worst doubts emerge.
The tunnel shows you the worst possible things that could happen to you.

So it was all a dream?

Well, sort of, my tiny friend.

More like a mirrage.
More like a mirage.
So...none of it was real?

See, that's the thing, it could be real.

If you want it to be real then it will become real.

Fire away little missy!
Fire away, little missy!
What do you see when you go through the tunnel?

Y-ya' know...nobody has ever asked me that before.

What I saw...was me crashing this train...

...killing every passenger.

...except me.

Is that what happened to you?

I should have slowed down...

That corner, the ice...

H-how do you know this?

This is going to sound strange.

But, I remember.

I remember being a passenger on this train when it crashed.

I just can't remember why I was on this train.

Then I must say, I deeply apologize little one.
Then I must say, I deeply apologize, little one.
How did you die?

I-In my home.

I thought I could drink away the pain.

Instead, I made it worse.

Once I had joined my passengers.

I could understand, what it felt like to be let down.
I can understand what it felt like to be let down.
They depended on me.

It wasn't your fault.

These things happen.

We don't control life.

Life controls us.

Are you sure you're the little girl I spoke to earlier?

You sound a lot older.

I don't know what is happening to me.

But whatever it is, I feel it has almost consumed me.

Like...I'm finally about to wake up.

Well, you are truly remarkable little one.
Well, you are truly remarkable, little one.
How is Stretch doin'?

H-he...didn't make it.

Poor kid.

It's okay little one.
It's okay, little one.
He has arrived at his final station.

Speaking of which!

So are we!
So have we!
Gustoph

Jeez! It's freezing out here!

But still, such an amazing view.

White fading into black.

I-Is this really me?

I don't normally talk like this.

Don't I?

Ahh! WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME!

I wish none of this ever happened!

I wish...I never...

Killed her.

!!!

What are you doing out here little guy?
What are you doing out here, little guy?
Little Jacket couldn't help be hear little girl.
Little Jacket couldn't help but hear little girl.
Little Jacket wants to know why little girl is screaming?

Uh, little girl does have a name ya' know.
Uh, little girl does have a name, ya' know.
Little Jacket already knows Luzia's name!

What Little Jacket doesn't know is why Luzia upset?

Because, I don't know if I'm myself anymore?

I act differently, I fight with my older sister a lot more.

I feel like I've done something really bad...

But I have no idea what I've done.

This reminds Little Jacket of a story.

A story called the two sisters.

The two sisters?

Have you not heard that story before?

Little Jacket will tell you.

Once upon a ti...

Is this going to be a long story?

Little Jacket doesn't have to tell you the story.

Okay,okay. Go ahead.
Okay, okay. Go ahead.
Once there were two sisters.

They were the best of friends.

They did everything together. They liked the same things.

They liked the same man.

Man only liked one of the sisters.

Man only liked the older one.

Man liked her silky smooth, lucious legs.
Man liked her silky smooth, luscious legs.
Younger sister was upset.

Younger sister wanted man to like her instead.
Younger sister wanted man to like her, instead.
Younger sister got witch to use magic to make legs like older sister.

Witch said, needs older sister's legs to make potion.

Younger sister cut off older sister's legs in her sleep.

Older sister died, lost too much blood.

Younger sister got nicer legs...but at a price.

Wait, I've heard this before.

Ashina...The Red Witch.

Red Witch yes, but not Ashina.

What do you mean by that.

Red Witch started curse.

Ashina not her real name.

Real name is...

Nice to see you again.

YOU ATE HIM!

Oh, I'm sorry.

You see, I'm very hungry Luzia.

And I still am.

WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME!?

Oh? You think this is about you?

HA HA!

No my little friend.

I'm here to see my sister.

I know she is on this train.

Sister?

Yes, the one you call...Sombria.

But she's my sister!

She was your sister.

And when I find her, I'm going to break those god damned legs of hers!
And when I find her, I'm going to break those goddamned legs of hers!
You will not lay a finger on her you witch!
You will not lay a finger on her, you witch!
Not one finger...all of my fingers.

And then once I kill her, you're next...

...Mother.

This looks like some sort of entertainment stage.

S-Sombie!?

Are you okay?!

I-I'm...

What's wrong?!

Hello Luzia.

It's you!

Give me back my sister!

Luzia, I don't have much time.

You need to listen to me.

Why should I listen to you!

You killed my sister!

Your sister is fine.

Trust me.

Why did you do this?

Because...I want this all to end.

What to end?

For hundreds of years, me and my sister have been stuck like this.
For hundreds of years, my sister and I have been stuck like this.
Trying to find a way to set us free.

I'm sorry Luzia, but this was the only way.

So you stole my sister's body?!

Do you think it is okay to steal other people's bodies?!

Luzia, you don't understand.

I don't have to!

This was your problem not ours!
This was your problem, not ours!
Turn my sister back now!

I can't.

Not until the curse has been lifted.

Then how do I lift the curse?!

By breaking the loop.

We are already on our way to break the loop!

You both are heading towards the begining.

Once you reach your home, you will restart the loop.

That's not true!

The Noodle Lady told me!

...mother.

Luzia, don't listen to her.

She is lying to you.

W-What do you mean?

She wants you to return home.

I will stay like this, for all eternity!
I will stay like this for all eternity!
That is not my problem.

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!

You should of thought about that before you kidnapped us.
You should have thought about that before you kidnapped us.
I-I know about your dreams.

The marketplace, the therapist.

Sombria won't admit that she has them to.
Sombria won't admit that she has them, too.
But why? Why would Sombie hide them from me?

It seems like she is protecting you.

Protecting me from what?

Sombria was easily drawn to me.

It's like we already had a connection.

But you...

Why you?

What is so special about you?

Mother warned me about you.

What are you talking about?!

It is remarkable that you have all the answers.

But why cant you answer this?
But why can't you answer this?
Luzia, something is going to happen soon.

And when the time comes...

You're going to have to make a choice.

What choice?

The choice to save your life...

...or hers.

You don't mean me and Sombria?!

If you choose to listen to her be warned.
If you choose to listen to her, be warned.
This will not go the way you think it will.

All I want is my sister back.

So we can go home.

But, there is something that still bugs me...

If you're not the Red Witch...

Then who is?

H-how did you know...

I finally found you.

Little sister.

Hiding in the bodies of the living.

For too long have I awaited this moment.

Hanging from your bathbouse wall like a photoframe.

Thinking of all those years how I could have spent my life.

Sister...I'm very sorr...

Shut up Ashina!

I've heard your lies through the centuries!

There is nothing you can say that will make me forgive you!

Please listen to me.

This little one, she may be the key to setting us free.

DON'T YOU SAY ANYTHNG ABOUT FREEDOM!

You have no idea what it's like to have your damed legs cut off!

Then chained to a wall for centuries!

This is all mother's fault!

Was it?!

What is going on?

Go on sis! Tell her one of your famous lies.

You and your sister were not picked randomly.

The curse is like a living mother.

In order for it to survive it must give birth.
In order for it to survive, it must give birth.
You two are it's newest children.
You two are its newest children.
The loop.

That's impossible!

We have a mother!

And so do we.

And she is going to pay also.
And she is going to pay, also.
Leave these two out of this.

They are more than welcome to leave.

But you aren't going anywhere.

Luzia, take your sister and go.

The answers you seek lie somewhere on this train.

But only if you wish to find them.

Now go!

Geez, Sombie, take it easy. It's just a prank.

A PRANK?!

I'LL SHOW YOU A PRANK!

Can you please keep it...

If you open your mouth again, I wil choke you with your fluid cord!

Sombie, calm down.

I'm...I'm sorry, Luzia.

I was really scared.

Scared of what?

That you wouldn't wake up.

Duh, that's what happens after you sleep.

You wake up.

Luzia, I want to say I'm sorry for everything.

I just wanted to show Mom I can be responsible.

And it seems like I failed both of you.

It's not your fault, Sombie.

It is, Luzia.

Because of me, you will never walk again!

That's because I'm lying down you dummy.

I guess they haven't told you yet.

Oh, wait!

I know what you're talking about!

The doctor said I'll be fine.

It was just a scratch!

Can you believe it?!

This is too good to be true.

Yeah, he thought I was someone else!

The nurse gave him the wrong files.

Oh! And they gave me cake to say sorry!

WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY TELL ME ANYTHING?!

Hey, pipe down!

You'll upset granny next door!
You'll upset Granny next door!
I just can't believe this all happened.

Right under my nose

I can't stand to see you like this anymore.
I want my sister back...

M-My real sister back.

Please, if you can hear me...

It doest not matter!

You will wake up! I know it!

I-I wish I just had slowed down.

The corner...the car...

I wish we never even went to see Mom that day!

I'm so sorry Luzia!

Because of my mistake you will never walk again!

Just please wake up!

I-I guess I'll just have to wait until you're ready.

Christ! *Sniff* I need a smoke.

I'll be right back Luzia.
I'll be right back, Luzia.

Sorry Verd. I've got stuff to do.

RealButcher

Hey Sombs, hows it goin'?

...Not so good.

Still worried about Luzia, eh?

She's a tough kid.

She'll be alright.

I hope so.

Still seeing the psychologist?

Got no choice.

Either this or jail.

What did you do to win that deal?

Tried to rob a gas station, with a butcher's knife and a mask.

So, I gave her a candy bar and waited for the cops.

At least you did the right thing.

Yeah, I guess!

Are you seeing him today?

Nah, I don't really want to see him anymore.

I don't blame ya'. The guy's a creep!

Anyway, I'll probably be ready to go in.

Hey! Can I ask you something?

Who does your hair?

It's so cute!

Uh, thanks.

My Mom does it for me.

It's a traditional look, apparently.

Pfft! She looks more like a big mouse!

I don't know why you want to look like her, Ashina.

Don't mind her, she's just jealous!

More like you're jealous!

Yeah, right.

The only thing I would be jelaous about, is that you're taller than me!
The only thing I would be jealous about is that you're taller than me!
She has really nice legs ya' know?
She has really nice legs, ya' know?

Our Mother died and she just took over.

Yeah, whats left of her that is.
Yeah, what's left of her, that is.
I'll catch up with you two later.

Okay, talk to you later.

I still love your hair!

I'm not in the mood for talking.

Talk to my sister, she never shuts up.

RealGustoph

Ah! Sombria my darling!
Ah! Sombria, my darling!
How's is da little one!?
How's da little one?!
She's getting much better!

The doctor said she could wake up anytime now.

That's grand news, young one!

I wish all the best for your younger sibling!

Thanks, Gustoph.

How is everything with you?

Well, so far, everything is good!

I have cut back de' drinking!

And I can return to work next week!

Well, maybe.

That's still good news!

I wish the best for you!

And hope you can drive those trains again soon!

Thank you, young one.

You're a very nice girl.

And I'm sure your sister will be fine.

RealStretch

Remember me?

O-oh yes.
O-oh, yes.
You're Somboro right?

Actually, it's Sombria.

But that was a pretty good guess.

I'm sorry about that.

I'm don't usually come in here.

Well, only to use the vending machine.

The one at the hotel is...

I know, I know. It's broken.

You say that every day when you come here.

I come here every day?

Yep, every break you have.

I noticed that you never buy anything from the machine.

I buy snacks from the machine all the time!

Okay, okay Mr. I'm not making it obvious.
Okay, okay, Mr. I'm not making it obvious.
Just make sure you don't stare at my butt for too long.

Was I really that obvious!?

I'm so sorry.

It's fine.

I've known for a while now.

I feel like an idiot.

I should hide in a closet somewhere.

And never come out.

Well, maybe you should.

But then you wouldn't be able to see my butt.

I promise I won't look at it anymore.

You can look at it when ever you want.

But next time, just talk to me.

It's much better way to break the ice.

Thanks, Sombria.

But I can't...

It'll haunt me til' the day I die.

Where is home?!

I-I remember this place...

I used to come here all the time.

W-When I was upset.

You did?

Why were you upset for?
Why were you upset?
I-I just, get like that sometimes.

I can't explain it.

So, you're depressed?

I'm not even surprised by your intelligence anymore.

Luzia, I've been like this for a very long time.

Does Mom know?

I don't like to share this with anyone.

But you told me.

Who else have you told?

Just my therapist.

I basically tell him everything.

But he doesn't help.

Isn't he supposed to?

I guess, but he...

...look, never mind.

You can tell me?

I-I can't...I'm sorry, Luzia.

I just need some time to myself, please.

Okay, I'm going to do some exploring.

Do you remember where the exit is?

I can't remember right now.

Okay, but don't go anywhere.

You can be depressed here okay?
You can be depressed here, okay?
Lighten up Sombie, it's just a joke.

I'll be back soon.

Boy, am I hungry!
Too bad I don't have any money!

It's...

another sink.

There's a loose pipe here.

It could be useful.

It's not working.

I wonder where it goes?

It's a long way down.

...a long way down.

...but.

It smells like.
It smells like...
Chocolate?

This seems so stupid.

What is that sound?

W-What are you?

*Shakes head*.

Can you talk?

Can you understand me?

*Nods*.

Okay, I need to reach the basement.

Is there a way down?

*Points to candy bar*.

You want this?

Well, could you do me a favor?

I need to turn on the backup generator.

Where did you go?!

Hey! You did it!

Here you go, you deserve it!

I wonder...

Why would people throw chocolate down the elevator shaft?

And yet, it smells like chocolate down here?

I-I can hear you in there.

I need to talk to you.

...please...

Leave me alone.

You know I can't do that, right?

You're my big sister!

I'm supposed to be around you to annoy you.

Y-you...you don't understand.

Luzia, you will never understand!

But Sombie...

I do understand.

I understand what it's like to be alone.

To have no one.

To have no life left to live.

That's why I made the loop.

You're just say...

Wait! What?!

I know who I really am now.

I am the one who caused all this.

You can't be!

I made this loop to protect you.

To protect me from what?!

F-From...

...killing yourself.

Killing myself?!

It's starting to make sense now.

Sombria, this is the place...

Where you die.

You are not my sister!

I was scared!

I was scared that I might lose you!

I was never going to!

I was going to chicken out!

Sometimes...we don't chicken out.

I know I can't stop you...

Even though I tried to.

I know this is not my choice.

It's yours.

I can't save you...

But I can help you.

We still have a shot to break the loop.

You need to trust me.

I...

...O-okay.

We need to do this together.

I think you were right about what you said before.

About what?

That this feels like someone elses problem.
That this feels like someone else's problem.
I don't know what is going to happen.

But I want you there when something does.

Luzia, thank you.

For everything.

So are you coming?

In a minute.

I sorta need to go while I'm in here anyway.
I sorta need to go while I'm in here, anyway.
Okay, I'll meet you at the exit.

I found this doll.

Do you want it?

I can't leave without Sombie.

There's something in the tray!

It's a candy bar!

A very old candybar!
A very old candy bar!
Yuck!

Maybe Sombie will eat it.

I could enter through here!

If I were a lot smaller.

I need to find something to widen the gap.

I'll use this to pry open the window.

I can just unlock the door now.

It's an old computer.

At least it still works.

Okay, now we have power.

There's a strange sound coming from this tunnel.

I think I'll leave it for now.

It's locked and won't budge.

I am Verdinya, but everyone calls me Verd.

Everyone?

Yes!

I have friends ya'know!
I have friends, ya'know!
So what are you doing here?

My sister and I are trying to get home.

We just got off the train.

Train?

Trains haven't come through this subway for 10 years!
Trains haven't come through this subway for ten years!
Wait?!

How can you see me right now?!

You're alive?!

So you're a ghost huh?
So you're a ghost, huh?
I'm not a ghost!

I'm a girl!

I'm just a dead girl!

What is your name?!

My name is Luzia...I think.

...Luzia?

You know me already?.

You're the one that did this to us!
You're the one who did this to us!
What?! Me?!

Yes! You witch!

I'm no...

...witch?

Thanks to you, we're all stuck in limbo!

Don't act dumb with me!

You're The Red Witch!

WHAT?!

THAT'S NOT TRUE!

THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

You are!

You're just...

A little girl?

That's because I am not the witch!

All of us deadies know you are!

To obtain ones true desire, the Red Witch will conspire!
To obtain one's true desire, the Red Witch will conspire!
You cannot lie to me!

But I'm...not...me...

Am I really the witch?

Why does everyone hate me?

Because you left us all in purgatory!
Because you left us all in Purgatory!
In this god forsaken loop!
In this godforsaken loop!
The loop?

Did I create the loop?

You don't know you're own story?
You don't know your own story?
Damn! You really did lose your mind!

I-I don't remember anything.

The last thing I remember is waking up.

I couldn't sleep, so I went to find Sombria.

I know Sombria!

She's the girl that comes here to cry!
She's the girl who comes here to cry!
To cry?

She said that she does come here whe she's...
She said that she comes here when she's...
Depressed?

Yeah, she does depress a lot, he he!

Why did I create this loop?

To punish us!

You put all of us in Purgatory!

All for your sisters sake!
All for your sister's sake!
My sister?

What are you talking about?

Do you know why your sister comes here all the time?!

Because she's depressed?

Ha ha!

All of us have a tragic story of how we died.

Your sister is looking for hers too.
Your sister is looking for hers, too.
...no...Sombie.

You created the loop to trap her and all of us here!

Just so you could keep her alive!

JUST LET HER DIE!!!

So we all can!

I...I can't.

You don't understand, she is my sister!

I don't understand?

I'M ALREADY DEAD!

I CAN'T MOVE ON!

We all have to make choices that we don't like.

What would happen if she did?

We could all move on.

The loop would be broken.

I have a hard choice to make.

You owe us.

We've suffered a lot longer than you have.

I need to speak to Sombria.

I'll be back.

Well, I ain't going no where.
Well, I ain't going nowhere.
Thanks to you.

LastChance

So...

What's it gonna be? Witch.

I have made my decision.

And?

I'm going to break the loop.

I'm going to be free from this nightmare?!

Yes, we all will.

Including my sister.

W-What?!

No!

Please!

We have suffered enough!

I don't know if I am one who made the loop.

But I do know, that I am the one to end it.
But I do know that I am the one to end it.
Let her die!

It's the only way!

There is...another.

I know there is.

FINE!

JUST LEAVE US HERE!

YOU WITCH!

Verd.

GO AWAY!

Before I go.

I thought you may want your doll back.

M-Molly?!

W-Where did you find her?!

My sister found her.

I-I lost her, over 10 years ago.
I-I lost her, over ten years ago.
I died trying to find her.

I...fell, onto the tracks.

How did you know she was mine?

I know what it's like to lose someone special.

It's a special sence you get.
It's a special sense you get.
T-Thank you.

We're just like you.

Trying to find a way home.

It looks like I was told a lie.

The Noodle Lady was wrong about you.

The Noodle Lady?

She talks about the story of the Red Witch all the time.

But she never mentioned you to be so...nice.

The Noodle Lady told you I was the Red Witch?

She said, only the Red Witch can break the loop.
She said only the Red Witch can break the loop.
But to break it, she must spill the blood of her sister.

I-I'm sorry for how I acted back there.

I've forgotten that I was once was alive.

I will break the loop...I promise.

Good luck, Luz...

What is it?

There's that laugh again.

Er...G-good luck Luzia.

Okay, your turn.

Well I dare you to kill me!

COME ON! KILL ME!

NO!

KILL YOURSELF!

...Truth.

Because I've got nothing to hide.

Wait, isn't it my turn?

We've all had enough turns at this game.

I want you to end it.

...How do I end the loop?

Kill the Red Witch.

Who is the Red Witch?

...Dare.

Kill me...

For Sombria.

Why is that your answer?

Sombie has suffered enough from me.

Ever since I was little.

All I ever did was get in her way, interupt her life.
All I ever did was get in her way, interrupt her life.
I don't deserve someone like her.

Go home...

Just go...now.

Self sacrifice...

Your mother was pathetic, in giving you my name...
Your mother was pathetic in giving you my name...
I did what was possible to keep my daughters alive.

But you're not going to take them away from me.

ACH_FAKE_LUZIA

We made it!

Sombie! We're finally home!

Yes...we did

It's good to finally see home again.

And now we can stop this cursed loop, and bring you back to normal!
And now we can stop this cursed loop and bring you back to normal!
...right?

I-I guess so.

Are you feeling alright, Luzia?

I feel great! Just like pickles!

Why? Arne't you feeling good, too?
Why? Aren't you feeling good, too?
O-Oh I am, but, you seem different now.

You seem...normal?

Umm, what are you talking about?

I've always been normal?

You seem, less intelligent than before.
You seem...less intelligent than before.
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?!

Are you calling me dumb?!

N-No no, I didn't mean it like tha...

Well, you're ugly! And stupid!

And you look like a freak!

Maybe...I am just a freak after all.

That's right! Run!

Another bobby pin?
How many does Sombie need to keep those balls of hair up?

The ground is soft here.

If only I had a shovel.

I wonder why the ground is soft.

Mom's garden is on the other side of the yard.

It's the Butcher's knife?
It's The Butcher's knife?
There's some writing on the handle.

Good luck kid! Butcher.

Heh, he trusts me with knives now.

Y-yes...I was sick
Y-yes...I was sick.
My poor darling.

Once you're done up there, I will make you a bowl of noodles.

O-okay.

Is there something wrong, Luzia? ?

You seem, shaken.
You seem shaken.
W-Who me?

I'm fine
I'm fine.
If you say so.

I'll wait here until you return.

I just want to say...thanks.

For helping me understand Sombria.

Oh, you're very welcome my dear.

I know what I have to do.

Were'd she go?!
Where'd she go?!
The big cry baby!
The big crybaby!
It's cold outside.

The windows are frosting over.

That's enough imagination for me.

Hey, can I ask you something?

Who? Me?

Yes, you.

You can ask me anything my deary.
You can ask me anything, my deary.
Truth or dare?

W-What?

This isn't the time to be playing gam...

Truth...or dare?

Fine!

Truth!

I've told you before!

I am Yokona Kagam...

You're lying again.

Luzia, you shouldn't be putting your nose into...

You seemed so eager to play this game with me before.

So play it with me now.

Who are you?!

I'm...Luzia...Sombria's conscience.

I am an older envision of you.
I am an older vision of you.
But a far better one.

Wait! Don't I get a turn.
Wait! Don't I get a turn?
Haven't you had enough turns at this game?

Why am I so different now?

Pfft!

Haven't you noticed anything lately?

Now that your Mother is gone...
Now that your mother is gone...
Your personallity will change, back to it's stupid self.
Your personality will change, back to its stupid self.
Your pathetic Mother's spirit was infused with yours.
Your pathetic mother's spirit was infused with yours.
Until she died! HA!

She failed to break the loop!

Now you will follow in her footsteps!

Enough of this pathetic game!

Your time is up, Luzia!

TRUTH OR DARE!

DARE!!!

What are you gonna do about that!

*Sniff*

I d-dare..

I dare you..

WHAT?! WHAT DO YOU DARE ME TO DO?!

I dare you, to listen to my little secret.

A secret?!

HA HA HA! Is that all?!

Okay, Luzia.

What's your secret?

For telling me the truth.

Finally.

I could really could just go back to bed.

I've missed you so much.

Wow! I never thought I'd ever say that!

But...I feel...

So...sleepy...

NO! I can't go to sleep just yet!

I can't keep my eyes open.

I can't take it anymore.

THE BAD ENDING

Sombie.

S-She's...gone.

She told you didn't she?

She told you everything.

She did.

So what are you going to do now?

I have to do what is right.

Then do it.

Where are you going?

I'm going to bed, it's late.
I'm going to bed. It's late.
What do you mean it's late?

Why wont you kill...

Because I don't have to.

I may be twelve, but I can tell when a story is done.

I'll see you in the morning.

But...h-how?

...Sombria

She doesn't know...does she?

What?! She doesn't know?

How many times has she been in this god forsaken loop?
How many times has she been in this godforsaken loop?
She needs to wake up.

You know she won't
You know she won't.
She needs to die!

Wait. Is that what you saw in the tunnel Sombria?
Wait. Is that what you saw in the tunnel, Sombria?
You know you cannot save her?

I can try.

She saved me remember?
She saved me, remember?
Besides, she's my sister...

Gee, you're up early.

I wanted to *Munch* eat some cereal!
I wanted to *munch* eat some cereal!
I can see that.

Sooo...

About last night?

You mean this morning?

Yes, I mean this morning.

Yeah?

How did you know?

How do I know what?

How did you know how to break the loop?

Oh! *Munch* That!

See, what I did was *Munch,munch,munch*

And then,*Munch,munch,munch*

Oh! And I also,*Munch,munch,munch*

And voila!,*Munch,munch,munch*

What kind of cereal are you eating anyway?

Hey! What are you doing in our house?!

Oh, me?

I thought I'd drop by.

Just to see if you two made it back alright.

It took a while, but we made it!

So, where's your sister?

Pffft, probably crying in her room.

Serve's her right for calling me dumb.
Serves her right for calling me dumb.
Now that is not very sisterly, is it?
Now, that is not very sisterly, is it?
I don't care!

She should be nice to me!

Yes, she should.

That's right!

She should!

It's not like she thanked me for helping her get home or anything!
It's not like she thanked me for helping her get home, or anything!
And it was me who did everything!

Maybe we should remind her of your efforts, Luzia.

But how?

Just tell her how ungrateful she was for you help.

That she just got in your way.

She is going to get it!

Not another sink.

I's Sombie's mug.

It smells like ciggaretts.
It smells like cigarettes.
I remember when Sombie caught her hands...

Wow...

That's not even funny anymore.

I don't need  to do that.

There's a picture on here.

It's the basement door.

But, the door looks like it's gonna fall off anyway.

Ah, you called my name.

It seems my Mother was wrong. You are the smart one.

And not Luzia.

Now that we're finally meeting, would you like to see something?

I can show you the TRUE ending to this story.

Are you ready?

Then kill my mother, and finish the game.
Then kill my mother and finish the game.
I can hear something.

It sounds like someone calling my name.

Should I call back?

It's a mirror.

Basement Door

Mirror

I-Is s-someone there?

H-Hello?

Lu...Luzia?!

Is that really you!

W-What are you?!

I-It's me!

P-please remember!

It's me!

M-Mom?!

Y-yes my sweetheart.

MOM!!!

What happened to you?!

This is going to sound strange to you...

But this is your sister's doing.

She created this place,these people...these stories.
She created this place, these people...these stories.
This is all Sombie's fault?!

Y-yes...and n-no.

See, your sister is a very special girl.

So I'm not special?!

You girls are very special to me.

I-I mean Sombria's a witch.

SOMBIE'S THE RED WITCH?!

Y-yes...

H-how do you know that?

All this time I thought I was!

Y-you've been speaking to t-the Noodle Lady have you?
Y-you've been speaking to t-the Noodle Lady, have you?
Yes, how do you know that!

I-It's the loop.

Everything that you've seen, heard and felt...

They're all just distractions.

I-It's Sombria's emotions...her imagination.

She created all of it....

But, why?

B-because...

S-she's...

...Depressed.

I've tried to talk to her.

But she won't listen to me.

I-I tried to break the loop m-myself.

But...I failed.

T-That's why I'm here.

But, you still have a chance, Luzia.

But why me?

I haven't been myself lately.

B-because you two are sisters, Luzia.

For some reason, you both can understand each other.

I can't explain it...

But, you two have a special connection with each other.

Y-you, both share each others thoughts, emotions and imagination.
Y-you both share each others thoughts, emotions and imagination.
I guess, parents just don't get it.
I guess parents just don't get it.
But, Luzia...

You...

Have to kill Sombria...

But...I can't.

Luzia! Please! I would have it any other way!

But this is the only way!

I can't kill my sister!

You have to, Luzia!

Please, it will bring everything to peace...

Even your sister.

How do I know you're not lying  to me?!

You were never there when we needed you!

Luzia! I did everything I could for you girls!

I even risked my own existance, to save Sombria!
I even risked my own existence to save Sombria!
I've sacrificed myself, to make sure you both have a life!
I've sacrificed myself to make sure you both have a life!
Please...you have to trust me.

But how would I kill her?

I left you a clue under Sombie's door.

I'm not sure if you got it earlier.

So I put it on the refrigerator.

Please...do this for Sombria.

I...I...

I know...

I can't make up you mind for you.

That's for you to decide...and you only.

Just, promise me something, Luzia.
Just promise me something, Luzia.
Yes Mommy?

Never forget, that I love you both, so very very much...
Never forget that I love you both, so very very much...
I won't, I promis...

A-are you still there?

W-what have you done?

M-my heart...

Why didn't you just let me die?

What's all this noise down here?

Sombria?!

Is that you?!

MOM?!

What are you doing down here?!

Sombria, please tell me you took the key with you?

W-what? N-no it's upstairs...

What was that?!

Wow! I didn't think you'd ever get sick of food.

Hey now! I said noodles, not food!

You leave food alone!

Okay, okay, geez.

Yeah...

I know, Luzia.

I'm sorry about Mom.

You couldn't help it.

I know she's still here.

Nagging us to brush our teeth and stuff.

Heh, maybe you to brush your teeth.

You mean, this whole time you were off the hook?!
You mean this whole time you were off the hook?!
I would have made you brush your teeth with the toilet brush!

Heh, it's good to have you back, Luzia.

And you too, big sis'!
And you too, Big Sis!
You know...

You still haven't told me how you figured all this out.

I know.

It's our little secret.

Our secret?

But you haven't told me?

No, not you.

The person behind the screen.

Okay, Luzia. Whatever you say.

Hey! After breakfast, I wanna show you something.

My little secret.

Okay, but it better not be a crab with a knife!

Those things are dangerous!

Luzia, you need to stop watching too much tv.
Luzia, you need to stop watching too much TV.
Think of what?

This place?

It's pretty neat.

It has a swing after all.
It has a swing, after all.
Well, at least you're enjoying yourself.

This is my secret place!

I usually come here to chill out.

But I can't really come here anymore.

How come?

Because I have to baby sit you silly!
Because I have to babysit you, silly!
But now, we can enjoy it together.

Hey, Sombie!

Mhmm?

How did all those people know your name?

What people?

All the people at the hospital.

They said goodbye to you on our way out.

Oh, they're just regulars.

I've been visiting you everyday.
I've been visiting you every day.
So I got to know them.

Huh, the funny thing is though...
Huh, the funny thing is, though...
All those people were in my dream.

But, they wern't people.
But they weren't people.
They were ghosts!

That's the imagination of a girl who watches too much TV!

Hey! At least I have an imagination.

Your'se would just be about boys and depressing music.
Yours would just be about boys and depressing music.
And I wouldn't change it for the world.

Speaking of boys...

You still seeing that looser?
You still seeing that losre?
Geez, when did you learn all of these fancy words?

And no.

I caught him making out with another girl...

In the back of his truck.

Doesn't he move furniture in that?

He did...until I rang his boss.

Kissing in a truck...eww, that's gross!

Don't ever change.

I won't.

But only if we can stay up late.

And, watch some horror movies!

Just don't tell Mom.

It's okay, I guess.

This is my secret I was telling you about!

I used to come here everyday, after school.
I used to come here every day after school.
It's...relaxing.

Lucky this place has a swing!

Otherwise, it would be boring!

Nothing ever pleases you, doesn't it?
Nothing ever pleases you, does it?
...Yeah...somethings.
...Yeah...some things.
Like...stuff.

Is it weird talking to me like this?

Well...yeah, a little.

You've never been this...happy, before.
You've never been this...happy before.
Yeah, that is weird.

So...what's gonna happen now?

Well, I guess I'm gonna have to look after you.

Seeing how...

Don't worry, her heart will always be inside of me.

*That sounded so weird*

It'll be okay.

Now that I have my big sis looking after me...

I can stay up as late as I want!

Oh no you ain't!
Oh, no you can't!
If you disobey me, you're living with Aunty Claire!

WHAT?! NO!

Her house is way too creepy!

Besides, she'll make me sleep with baby Mark!

He'll keep me up all night!

Hey, Luzia.

Calm down, I'm just kidding.

Hey, Sombie.

If you're the witch...

Where's your pointy hat and broom?

Luzia, I think this would be the best time to tell you.

We come from a very strange family.

Mom once told me, tha you and I share our great ancestors gift.
Mom once told me that you and I share our great ancestors' gift.
A gift?

Like super powers?

Ha! No, more like...un-natural abilities.
Ha! No, more like...unnatural abilities.
Well, that's what Mom called it.

Mom made me see that therapist every week.

Because you were depressed?

She wanted me to control my emotions.

But, when I couldn't control them anymore.
But when I couldn't control them anymore...
I created the...loop.

Please, don't make another one!

I can't stand the site of noodles anymore!

Ha ha! I don't think I will, Luzia.

I'm free to do what I want now.

Except smoking!

You promised!

I said maybe, Luzia.

Hmm, okay.

What's my gift?

I-I don't know, Luzia.

Mom said you did have one.

She just said you have a great imagination.

Thats not really a gift.

Everyone has an imagination, Sombie!

I guess you just have one of a kind.

IN MEMORY OF MY COUSIN BLAKE

Always thinking of you!

You don't have what it takes!

I had that dream again

It's like a broken record

Going around and around

A BAD DREAM?

Our lives would change, forever.
Our lives would change forever.
IS THIS ALL REAL?

But I don't need any help!

I'm fine! There's nothing wrong with me!

TAKEN

Everything will be okay...

ESCAPE?

W-What is happening to me?

OF BLOOD AND WATER

A LONG RIDE HOME

Heh, ya know...

THE BUS STOP

It's kinda creepy out here...

COLD RAILS

What will happen once we reach home?

Will Luzia and I go back to the way we were?

Will I lose my sister...

Forever?

WAKE UP...PLEASE?

It shows us our worst realities.

I couldn't tell her the truth about what I saw.

OUR LAST STOP

BREAK OR STRENGTHEN

Or is it?

The truth lies in the reflection of my name.

HAPPILY EVER AFTER

Thank you, Luzia.

We did it!

SECRET END

Stranga Games says: Thanks for playing!

Like I told you before, I don't need your help!

I-I'm sorry, Sombria...

we'll figure this out soon, I promise.

The lock's broken!

\"Feel fresh with our new cola Buzz Blast\"

They smell horrible, like something died in-

Oh, the poor things.

Boiler Door Unlocked

Wait, there's something in there.

I can't reach it, my hands won't fit through the cage.
I can't reach it - my hands won't fit through the cage.
A little closer.

There! I wonder what you unlock, little key.

Hey! Now there's something I can use!

I can see something shiny!

I need something to reach it, though.

It's a flashlight...

this could be useful.

Well, I guess I don't need this coat hanger anymore.

Hello there my child, are you lost?

the next thing I knew, I woke up here.

Are you hungry? Can I get you anything?

How about some of those tasty noodles?

I insist...

here you are.

Do you know where I am?

This is the Downtown Marketplace, why? Are you lost?

I'm not sure.

I'm not sure about that either.
I'm not sure about that, either.
Well, maybe you should just wait here...

it'll make it easier for them to find you.

I guess you're right.

I-It's an air duct...

maybe I can find a way out through here?

I'll need to find a light before I go in.

That's better! I can see where I'm going now.

I hope this'll help us find a way home.

Oh, thank you!

I thought I'd never find it.

Wait a second, that's not Mom's car!

Maybe it's Sombie's boyfriend? Doesn't he own a moving truck?

She better not be hiding in there!

You gonna tell mom?
You gonna tell Mom?
It sounds like you're calling me a \"zombie\".

I wouldn't want to cuddle a zombie.

You mean the one where I'm like this 

 thing? 

Yep!

you better get back to bed, mom's gonna be home soon.
you'd better get back to bed, Mom's gonna be home soon.
Besides, it's cold out here.

Ok, Ok, I'm going inside.

I used to pick Sombie's room with these.

Why do I feel a sharp pain in my neck?

Home

Garden Bed

The same freakin' dream!

*Sigh* Great!

Now I can't get back to sleep!

Better see what Sombie's up to.

Ok, lets get some sleep!
Ok, let's get some sleep!
Oh, yeah! The lights!

Better turn them off.

Like duh.

Maybe a fuse or something?

MOM! MOMMY! THE LIGHT'S BLEW UP!
MOM! MOMMY! THE LIGHTS BLEW UP!
I bet Sombie's just tryin' to scare me again.

SOMBIE! YOU'RE GONNA GET IT!

Hmm, I think I'll go for a glass of milk!

Although, those noodles do sound delicious!

Weird place for a screwdriver? Shouldn't it be in a tookbox?
Weird place for a screwdriver? Shouldn't it be in a toolbox?

Where did I even get this bow from?

I better stay out of her room, she'd kill me.
I'd better stay out of her room. She'd kill me.
Besides, it's locked.

Great! The boby pin broke anyway!

Huh? What's this? A photo?

Who drew this?

No internet on it anyway, it's for school work.
No internet on it anyway, it's for schoolwork.
I should really find Sombie first.

And just where do you think you're going? Hmm?

Whatever, just hurry up and get to bed! Mom's gonna be home soon, and you'll be in trouble then.

GRR! JUST HURRY UP, LUZIA!

Okay, okay! Yeesh!

Sounds like Mom's car, you better get to bed now!

Hey! Watch your language, Luzia! Bed! Now!

I bet she wants me to follow that trail of \"blood\", but guess what, I'm not dumb enough to fall for that!

Huh, well, she's not in here.

Huh, it's a sink. That's pretty neat!

I would use this mug but Sombie's been slobbering all over it.
I would use this mug, but Sombie's been slobbering all over it.
Yuck! Smells like cigarettes! How come mom hasn't noticed yet?
Yuck! Smells like cigarettes! How come Mom hasn't noticed yet?
Sombria! Open up, I know you're in there!

Gee, I wonder why \"assface\" gets to stay up so late? She doesn't even do anything besides being annoying!
Gee, I wonder why \"assface\" gets to stay up so late? She doesn't even do anything besides be annoying!
Maybe I should tell Mom she's smoking? Nah, that's probably a bad idea, she'll Mom about my Mr. Roachy.

I need to find a better home for it besides Sombie's underware draw.
I need to find a better home for it besides Sombie's underwear drawer.
Anyways, I better get back to bed.

I can't believe Mom kept that stupid cat drawing! I did that when I was three!

I should have drawn a tiger, much cooler!

Somehow, I don't think mom's gonna like it.
Somehow, I don't think Mom's gonna like it.
You can ask me anything, Luzia.

why am I really here?

I think your sister's death is the key to your problem.

Luzia, we've been through this. She's dead, you must accept it.

Good, we finally made some progress.

hanging, in her room.

You're lying!

Like, ghosts, spirits?

A poltergeist, maybe?

People?

Oh yes...

It doesn't help, it makes things worse. I can't even remember the last time I saw you.

It has to relate to how you feel right now.

Pick anything you want in this room and bring it to me.

I'll assess you afterwards.

Ick, a brain...

II better take this, he'll think I'm smart or something. 
I'd better take this. He'll think I'm smart or something.
DollChoice

Hey! A doll!

In a creepy sorta way.

Hmm, I can assure you it means more than just \"cute\".

This to me, means vulnerability.
This, to me, means vulnerability.
Are you feeling fragile, Luzia?

Did your parents ever \"hurt\" you, or \"touch\" you in any wa-
Did your parents ever \"hurt\" you or \"touch\" you in any wa-
What?! No!

She would never do such a thing! And I've never even met my dad!

Besides, mom's never home, she's always working.
Besides, Mom's never home, she's always working.
What about your sister?

What the heck are you on about?!

First my mom, and now it's my sister?

Well, Luzia, you picked the doll.

I picked it because it was cute. I like dolls!

You're holding back, Luzia.

It's ok to tell me, I want to help you.

Touch you? I knew it!

No, she didn't \"touch\" me, she...

did hurt me.

S-She said I was adopted. That we're not really sisters...

Luzia-

I'll have the receptionist book your next appointment and please, take your medication.

Because I'm smart!

It's also all pink and squishy!

a \"smart ass\".

*I can see why.*

look, I don't want to talk about her anymore.

We still have another twenty minutes left, Luzia.

I said, no more.

You can't do that to me anymore.

Hurt me.

Touch me.

The medication helps me forget, remember?

what it means to feel \"dead inside\".

G-Get the hell away from me!

W-WHAT IS THAT THING?!

That?

That's Sombria.

IMPOSSIBLE!

Told ya so!

Well? W-Wait, Sombie, what are you doing?

STAY AWAY!

Why'd you have to bite off his head for?!
Why'd you have to bite off his head?!
God dammit!

ee wass hurrrrtinnnng youuu, Luzzzzia.

You're not scary, Sombie.

Luzia, I'm always weak, tired, and extremely hungry.

I'm sorry, but I can't stand it! This body aches! The pain...is excruciating!

Do I look fine to you? I'm a hideous creature!

THIS ISN'T FUNNY!

You wouldn't know a thing about being depressed, Luzia!

I-I'm sorry, Sombie.

I just want to help-

You can't Luzia...
You can't, Luzia...
there's no one in there.

I hope I don't see \"you\" anymore.

I'm here just like everyone else.

I've got some problems I need sorting.

But what about you, my darling?

Taking your sister out to lunch?

There's nothing I can do for her...

she doesn't want my help.

Pfft! That's what they all say.

I'm just an old Lady, after all.
I'm just an old lady, after all.
She doesn't want my help.

It's not easy, is it? But it's not impossible either.
It's not easy, is it? But it's not impossible, either.
I don't know why you're seeing this fool!

I should start my own clinic, and get outa the noodle business.

You're twelve, you're better figuring this out than me!
You're twelve, you're better at figuring this out than me!
Besides...

the key to your problems are better off flushed away.

what I said back there, I didn't really mean it.

Why do you look-

M-Maybe you're right...

you should have let me die.

Well, it's too late, little sister.

She's right...

this is all my fault.

I keep making it worse.

Don't worry, Sombria.

I'll fix this...

It's holding a key...

you've got to be kidding me.

I remember when my cousin Mark said he was eaten by a toilet once...

that does sound quite terrifying.

I don't know, Luzia!

Stop asking me!

Easy! This has to be a prank!

Huh? Well that's not good.

Who's ''they''?

We must be in Little Tokyo.

Hopefully you girls had a smooth ride?

You're both probably wanting an explanation for all of this?

Actually, I wanna know why you're naked?

Well, aren't you the mischievous one.

Oh! But where are my manners?

But everybody calls me The Red Witch.

Your sister was a bonus that idiot brought along.

A pair of long, beautiful, luscious legs.

Especially those long, silky, luscious legs.

She ain't gettin' your stilts, lady!

And you're more than welcome to say no Sombria.

Surely a mother can visit her daughter?

You are no mother of mine.

That is her speciality my daughter.

I'm not leaving without her!
Luzia, I admire your bravery...

Something you'll regret if you lay one finger on her!

You mean...like this?

Heh, whoops! Sorry, Luzia...

but she's mine now.

Once complete, I'll be taking her body as my own, she'll remain here...

The changes are...permanent, Luzia.

She is no longer your sister but a portal to my salvation!

Y-You're wrong...

Luzia! Lets go!

It's!!

There's only one other person who uses this laundromat...

and she only comes in on Tuesdays.

Actually, it's a little cold.

it must be Tuesday.

Otherwise...you will be stuck in the curse's loop forever.

I know someone who can take you as far as the countryside.

Well, it's about time I introduced myself.

The witch is your daughter?

I never want to set foot back in that place again!

Look at the never-ending line of fences!

It's a proven fact you can't smell yourself.

Little Jacket knows how! Give the keycard to Little Jacket!

A keycard is what you need, but you need to find it!

Litle Jacket saw big scary girl looking back here not long ago.

Is this what you need?

Open sesame!

Little Jacket will lock the door if you say that again.

Ug, ''little girl'' does have a name, ya know?

What Little Jacket doesn't know is, why is Luzia upset?

Haven't you heard that story before?

Okay, okay. Go ahead.

What do you mean by that?

Wait, what's that noise?

And when I find her, I'm going to break those god damn legs of hers!

What?! Have you been in my room again?!

Strange. I don't remember asking for you to be kidnapped.

If it's who I think it is, she's in for a world of pain and suffering.

Like I said, you're here forever.

Just watch your back, you old, pathetic, woman!

Find her and get out while you still can!

Listen kid, just get out! She is coming for you!

just hang in there, and try not to lose your head- I mean her head!

What was that?! Some kind of joke?

CandyBar:Cutscene

Can you let me down? I need to pick myself up!

sorry about before, got a little tied up in my emotions.

Don't make me blush! Really, I'll kill ya! Oh! before I forget, I got you something.
Don't make me blush! Really, I'll kill ya! Oh! Before I forget, I got you something.
It's over there, on the bench.

Yes! Some delicious noodles!

I knew there was something to eat around here-

I don't think roaches were in the recipe. *Yuck!*

I'll just take the chopsticks.

Excuse me, Mr. Butcher.

Have you met the lady on the wall?

*Sigh* Why didn't I just kill her why I had the chance?

I should've just gutted'er like a fish...

*Sigh* Well, last time I played her little game she wanted an object or something?

What if the witch finds out? You're not the only one who'll be gutted, again.
What if the witch finds out? You're not the only one who'll be gutted again.
Just do what the lady wants, she can take the blame.

I can shed some info on it for you.

Thanks! Oh, and by the way...

It's in my car, why?

I think you're lying.

Do I need one?

Kid, you ask way too many questions!

Can I have that big knife?

I just got a chill down my spine, and I don't even have a spine.

No, it's mine.

Can't have everything we want, sorry, lil' creepy girl.

What if I find you a face?

Well, I wouldn't say no to one. I could use a face lift.

Really? Who'd you steal it off?

Oh, a mask.

Thanks, kid!

Sure, go nuts!

Just be responsible with it.

You don't wanna go round killin' anyone with it or anything. But why do I care. Enjoy!

Wait! *Sniff*...maybe I do.
there's something shiny in there.

Maybe Sombie has something that can open this.

Just like Sombie's door.

Whoops! The hairpin broke!

Sorry, Sombie.

Why is it smiling?

Sombie! Where the heck have you been!?

Ok, ok!

You need to cut your hand...

spill your blood in the circle!

Luzia, hurry! Get in the other circle!

Just wait.

I know you're in here! I can smell you!

Pipe down in there, freak!

Wait, Luzia?

Uh oh.

\"It\" is not my name...

I am known as \"The Lady On The Wall\".

Such a dark place to be in for one with such a...\"bright\" name. 

You bring me something that I want and I'll tell you how to escape, deal?
You bring me something that I want and I'll tell you how to escape. Deal?
I could just eat you now? Save me the trouble of waiting.

Why are you here?
Yuck! No thanks!

I have no idea where we are or what this \"spirit place\" is?
I have no idea where we are or what this \"spirit place\" is.
and some mumbo jumbo about breaking the \"loop\".

Here you go, Sombie.

This'll keep you dry.

Yep.

You look silly.

So, find anything interesting in there?

After everything we've seen, what is ordinary?

What's gonna happen with us? When this is all over?

it'll all go back to normal, I hope.
It'll all go back to normal, I hope.
The fighting, the arguing...stuff like that?

it all depends.
It all depends.
I have a feeling that I'm never gonna hear the end of this, once we get home.

Oh, you better believe it sister!
Oh, you'd better believe it Sister!
Fantastic!

Yep! I'm gonna remind you every day...

about how you saved my life.

So, you're not mad at me?

When you get older things become more complicated...

sometimes, I wish I could be as young as you again.

But we can't go back...

I won't be going anywhere.

I get what you mean.

I thought you never would-

Just promise me one thing.

Please, quit smoking. You're stinking up the whole house!

We'll see, Luzia. Depends on how much of a brat you'll be towards me. Heh.

and I'm still hungry!

Hmm, seems like you and Sombria are in a bit of a mess.

Yes, we are-

Wait! How did you-

Tell me, are you planning on breaking your \"loop\"?

AHH!

What the heck is going on?

I have absolutely no idea, Sombie.

I think I can fix-

Little? Little Jacket is not little!

Everyone else is just too big!

Well, when you put it that way I guess you're right.
Well, when you put it that way, I guess you're right.
What's in the bowl! You adorable little thing, you!

Yes it is I! Little Jacke-

I think you're lying, little man.

Little Jacket needs a keycard to unlock this door.

Little Jacket can crawl through the vent and unlock it from the other side.

Damn! How did she escape?!

Whoopsie daisy!

Wait...I NEED TO WARN SOMBIE!

y-you.

You're just so cute!

I could just take you home!

Please...go away.

Little Jacket wonders what Mudo is doing?

Hmm, it looks like it could work.

Little Jacket will try.

Whoops! I mean thank you!

P-Pleased to meet you, Luzia.

You mean the loo- Wait!

Please, tell me what you know about me. PLEASE!

Please, forgive me.

Bad things!?

Bad hit you a long time ago, pal!

I'll j-just be out of your way...

...no. I'm sorry.

I feel like a great, big, jerk!

I feel sleepy.

Why did she do it?

She risked her own life to save mine!

Was mine worth all the trouble?

She lost everything because of me...

everything.

Who wrote this?

If you're reading this then be prepared for what's about to happen.
If you're reading this, then be prepared for what's about to happen.
You're not who you think you are...

and neither is she.

You were born from a witch and she was born from a saviour.

The loop is the only thing that binds you both together...

if you break it, you may not see each other again.

It's time...

time to end this mess.

She has to go!

I can't keep protecting her...

I'm losing my strength.

She is manipulating you.

kill her.

B-But that's impossible!

And nothing gets past Gustoph too...
And nothing gets past Gustoph, too...
because he takes up the entire doorway!

HA!

I'm sure I did, little one.

A ghoulish girl with long arms is pretty hard to miss.

Yes, goulish, or ghost-ish.
Yes, ghoulish or ghost-ish.
Before you go, could you please check on my buddy, Stretch?
Before you go, could you please check on my buddy Stretch?
I-I think I did...

where does he like to hide?

Can I-

*Whistling* ...Oh!

Well, I'm the guy who drives this train, of course!

how the heck did you get in here?

So that's where I left the darned keycard!

They call me Gustoph! But you can call me Gus.

She's a person too, y'know!
She's a person, too, y'know!
So, you on holiday?

No, but I sure'll need one after all this.

Been in a bit of a pickle have we, missy?
Been in a bit of a pickle, have we, missy?
I can't believe we're finally on our way home to end all of this mess.

Well, I'm glad it all worked out for ya.

Where's the rest of the passengers?

They're probably just shy...

or maybe they're scared of something.

You'd best be gettin' back to your cabin, little missy.

Once we're in the valley of sorrows, you don't wanna be wonderin' around.
Once we're in the valley of sorrows, you don't wanna be wanderin' around.
Alive?!

H-Hey, Sombie. Are you okay?

What home?

What do you mean? Our home.

So what, it's not like it's gonna change anything.

Of course it will!

Please, don't give up on me now!

Luzia, do you remember what happened before this all happened?

...n-no.

What do you remember about mom?
What do you remember about Mom?
Well, not much...

she was never around.

I guess it's because she was too busy working at the hospital-

Luzia, we don't have a mother.

Y-Yes we do! What do you mean by-

She's not our real mother. We were both left on her door step when we were born...
She's not our real mother. We were both left on her doorstep when we were born...
we're not even real sisters.

I've been lying to you this whole time...

I-I'm sorry...Luzia.

*Sniff* P-Please, tell me this is a joke, right?

It has to be!

*Sniff*I don't know who to trust anymore?!

...I feel empty inside.

Luzia, please-

Hey!

Come here, quick!

Huh? Gus?

Sorry little one, but I couldn't help over hearing your conversation.
Sorry, little one, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
What's it matter anyway?
What's it matter, anyway?
You don't believe that garbage, do you?!

What did I tell'ya earlier? Hmm?

U-Uh, I forgot.

Well, at least we're out the other end.

Ho Ho! The valley!

I see the valley of sorrows has affected your mind!

The valley of sorrows?

When the train passes through the valley, your worst fears become a reality.

Sort of, my tiny friend.

More like a vision.

So, none of it was real?
So none of it was real?
But the valley will always show the worst outcome.

What do you see when you go through the valley?

Heh, Y'know, nobody's ever asked me that before...apart from one other.

What I saw was how I ended up here. I crashed my train...

killing all but one passenger...

...me.

It's not your fault, little missy...

it's mine.

Strange, you remind me of someone I used to know.

This is going to sound even stranger...

but I remember you.

I remember a cabin in the misty woods...

I just can't remember anything else.

...Ash?

No, it's can't be.
No, it can't be.
I-In my home...

Instead, I made it worse...

once I had joined my passengers...

I could finally understand, what it felt like to be let down...

they depended on me.

It wasn't your fault, Gus.

We don't control life...

life controls us.

You sound a lot like someone else I used to know.

Whatever it is, I feel it's almost consumed me.

Like, I'm finally about to wake up.

Well, you are truly remarkable, little one.

H-He, didn't make it.

He's arrived at his final station.

So have we!

Train Engine

HEY! GIRL!

\"Little girl\" does have a name, ya know?

What Little Jacket doesn't know is; why is Luzia upset?
What Little Jacket doesn't know is: why is Luzia upset?
I act differently, I've been fighting with Sombie more...

I just have no idea what I've done.

A story called \"Two Birds One Stone\".

\"Two Birds One Stone\"?

You haven't heard of \"Two Birds One Stone\"?

Ok, Little Jacket will tell you, so listen up!

Once upon a ti-

SHHH!

Okay, okay! Go ahead.

Once upon a time, there were two sisters that lived in the country-side.
Once upon a time, there were two sisters that lived in the countryside.
They were the best of friends and did everything together.

They were so close that they liked and enjoyed the same things...

especially this one man.

However, the man only had eyes for one of the sisters...

the taller one.

Younger sister was so upset by this that she tried everything she could to be taller.

So, younger sister got a witch to use magic to make legs longer, just like older sister.

In order for the witch's magic to work, she had to cut off older sister's legs...

and she did in her sleep.

Younger sister got what she wanted but was also given a curse.

Wait! I've heard this before...

I remember something...about a theater.

You should remember, Luzia.

Because you're the-

Wait, what's that sound?

Ah! Hello, Luzia.

Nice to finally see you again.

YOU ATE HIM! YOU ATE THE LITTLE GUY!

Oh, I'm sorry. He looked like the perfect snack.

I have been for centuries...and I still am.

I'm here to see my sister!

I know she's on this train.

Yes, the one you call \"Sombria\".

WAIT!

She's my sister!

When I find her, I'm going to break those god damn legs of hers!
When I find her, I'm going to break those goddamn legs of hers!
You're not laying a finger on her, you ugly lady!

Not just one finger but all of them. Right around her throat!
Not just one finger, but all of them. Right around her throat!
Once I kill her, you're next...

mother.
Mother.
I-I-

Hello, Luzia.

It's you! The witch!

Look what you did to Sombria!

Your sister is fine, Luzia.

Then why did you do this?

It's the only way to end this, to end the loop.

The curse loop?

You may be still too young to understand but you and I are closer than you think.
You may be still too young to understand, but you and I are closer than you think.
This isn't the first time we've met.

I need Sombria's body to-

So you stole my sister's body!

Luzia, you don't understand. Please, listen-

This is your problem not ours!
This is your problem, not ours!
I can't...

not until the curse has been lifted.

You have to break the loop, Luzia.

You've been tricked...

once you reach home, you will restart the loop. You'll ruin everything!

The Noodle Lady told me that it would end the curse!

...Yoko? That crone! What are you playing at?

Wait...she want's the sister?
Wait...she wants the sister?
What, Sombria?

That old hag! She want's to kill us all before we end the curse.

If she ends Sombria, Tena and I will be stuck like this forever!

I'll never get my life back!

That's not my problem, it's yours! I just want Sombria back! And I have to return home to do it, then so be it!

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO US! I SAVED YOUR LIFE!

Pfft! As if! You should of thought about that before you kidnapped us.
Pfft! As if! You should have thought about that before you kidnapped us.
Wait! Luzia, I-I know about your dreams...

The marketplace, the therapist...all of it.

It's a bond that we both share. I wasn't lying when I said we have met before.

You're lying! I've never seen you in my entire life, lady!

I-I wish you could just...remember.

Just give me back my sister...

please.

It's like we're one soul living in two bodies. I don't understand it myself but...

I wish I could explain it.

Luzia, whatever happens...

don't ever let your Sombria go...

or she'll share the same fate as my sister.

Heh. Like I said, you're too young to understand...

but someday, you will.

Luzia, if you choose this path...

you're going to have to make a choice.

To save your life, or Sombria's
To save your life, or Sombria's.
Wait, why?! I can't save us both?!

If you choose to listen to her be warned...
If you choose to listen to her, be warned...
this will not go the way you think.

Look! All I want is my sister back!

I want us to go home! So everything can go back to the way it was.

me too.

T-There's something still bugging me...

if you're not The Red Witch...

then who is?

It's yo-

Huh? What was that noise?

Finally! I found you.

Hiding in the bodies of the living, are we?

I have waited a very long time for this moment.

I've been hanging from your bathhouse wall...

thinking about all those years on how I could have spent my LIFE!

Tena, I'm sorr-

SHUT IT, ASHINA!

The time for forgiveness is over!

YOU TOOK EVERYTHING FROM ME!

Please, Tena! Listen to me.

Luzia, is our chance to setting us free-
Luzia is our chance to set us free-
DON'T YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT FREEDOM!

Then chained to a wall for an eternity!

This is all Yoko's fault!

Was it?! She told me everything, big sis!
Was it?! She told me everything, Big Sis!
About how pathetic I was, about how jealous you were of everything I had!

Go on, sis! Tell her another one of your famous lies!
Go on, Sis! Tell her another one of your famous lies!
Luzia, I-I-

Ha! Pathetic! You kidnapped a little girl and her sister to escape the curse without me!

You were going to leave me in that dark disgusting bathouse, forever!
You were going to leave me in that dark disgusting bathhouse forever!
So you are a liar!

Heh! You too, aye?

Typicall!

Leave these two out of this, Tena.

They are more than welcome to leave...

but you aren't going anywhere.

Luzia, please listen to what I've told you.

You can end this, you have to believe me!

Just keep Sombria safe!

P-Pleasssse.

H-Help...meee.

I'm trying to listen out for my-

OH, SHUT UP! YA OLD CAVE BAT!

YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE NOT HERE!

Hmmph! How rude!

W-we need t-to go home-.

Yes, we do! And now we can! I can't believe you're-

I-I'm sorry, S-Sombie...

No, NO!

B-B-but, h-how?

I've been awake for the last couple of days now.

I just unplugged my heart machine cord, thingy.
I just unplugged my heart machine cord thingy.
Geez, Sombie! Take it easy, It's just a prank.

Can you both please keep it down!

I'm sorry, Luzia.

I-I was really scared, y'know.

I just wanted to show mom I can be responsible...
I just wanted to show Mom I can be responsible...
and it seems like I failed both of you.

Just look what happened to you.

What did happen to me?

You were in a coma for about three months.

You went to get a glass of milk but never came out of the kitchen.

Wait, milk? What about the kidnapping? The bathhouse?

Did I just dream it all?

What are you talking about, Luzia?

Bathhouse?

Yeah, and you were some freakiy lookin' ghost thing with long arms!

Dang, it must've been a dream.

Sounds like one heck of a dream though.
Sounds like one heck of a dream, though.
I'm just glad your ok!
I'm just glad you're ok!
It just didn't feel like a dream.

I swear!

Well, now that you're awak maybe I can see the nurse...
Well, now that you're awake, maybe I can see the nurse...
and we can get the heck outta here.

Sure, just let me go see the nurse real quick, ok?

And that was the most sketchiest looking motel in Ash Pines.
And that was the sketchiest looking motel in Ash Pines.
I wish you'd just wake up, Luzia.

So we can go home...

please...

m-my real sister back.

It's been 3 months now!
It's been three months now!
*Sniff* I sure could use a smoke.

Mr. Gus always goes on about his drinking problem.

Mom said she'd be here soon.

She works here for crying out loud.
She works here, for crying out loud.
*Sigh* Who am I kidding...

you can't hear me anyway.
you can't hear me, anyway.
I'm waiting for my daughters to arrive and I can't hear them.

I'll keep it down.

I-It's a giant doll?

Heh, I know Verdinya.

Now, don't you loose her again, ok?
Now, don't you lose her again, ok?
I won't, Sombria!

I hope.

I'm sure she'll wake up soon!

You wanna play tea parties?
You wanna play tea party?
Sorry, Verd. I've got stuff to do.

Oh well, maybe next time.
Oh, well, maybe next time.
Nick

Not so good.

Still seeing the therapist?

It's either this or jail.

What did you do this time?

Tried robbing a gas station, again.
Tried robbing a gas station again.
I just couldn't do it in the end.

I scared the heck outta this kid standing next to me.

I just couldn't see the poor girl cry.

So, I gave her a candy bar and we chatted til the cops arrived.

That was nice of you, in a horrific kinda way.

I don't really want to see him anymore.

I don't blame ya, the guy's a creep!

I'll catch ya later, Sombs!

Ah! Sombria!

How's the little one?!

Not good, it's been 3 months now.
Not good, it's been three months now.
I'm not sure what's wrong with her.

I'm sorry to hear that, young one!

Thanks, Gus.

How's everything with you?

I been hitting those tripple A meetings every week and the liver's getting back to her ol' self!
I been hitting those triple A meetings every week and the liver's getting back to her ol' self!
They say I can return back to work in a few days!

That's good news!

I'm proud of you, Gus!

I hope you can drive those trains again!

I'm sure your sister will be fine.

Hey.

O-Oh yes!

You're Sombria, right?

I sure am!

So, whatcha' doin', Stretch?

I'I'm just grabbing a soda from the machine.

the one at the hotel is-

Broken? I presume?

Y-Yes, how did you-

You tell me, like every day that it's broken.
You tell me like every day that it's broken.
I've also noticed that you never buy anything from it either.

O-Oh...

I b-buy snacks from the machine all the t-time!

Uh huh, sure.

Just remember I have a nice face too, Stretch.
Just remember I have a nice face, too, Stretch.
*Blush* Was it really that obvious!?

I'm s-so sorry!

Ha! It's fine!

G-Gosh! I f-feel like a complete idiot!

I should hide in a closet a-and never come out!

Well, you ain't gonna see no butt from in there.

But hey, just sayin'.

Pfft! C'mon, Stretch! I don't care if you do.

Just try talking to me, next time.

I don't bite, promise.

O-Ok.

*Blushing* Thanks, S-Sombria.

W-What the...

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?!

It's so peaceful outside.

and such a quiet night, too.

It feels like she has been that coma forever...

I just need a sign...

anything...

please?

I better head inside...

what a quiet night though.
what a quiet night, though.
It'll haunt me til' the day I die if you don't.

SceneSetup

I-I just...get like that sometimes.

I don't like to share it with anyone.

Just my therapist...

I basically tell him everything...

but he doesn't help.

look, never mind.

I-I can't. I'm sorry, Luzia.

Ok, well, I'm going to do some exploring.

You can be depressed here, ok?

Lighten up Sombie! It's just a joke.

A very long way down!

Wait...

it smells like...

chocolate?

Here you go! You've earnt it!

It's a long way down. I'd need a good enouh reason to throw this down there...
It's a long way down. I'd need a good enough reason to throw this down there...
huh, it smells like...chocolate?

leave me alone.

I'm supposed to be around you to annoy you!

Y-You don't understand.

To have no one you can talk to.

How could you possibly understand, you're only twelve.
How could you possibly understand? You're only twelve.
It's because I have a connection with you, we're sisters after all.

You're not going to believe me, I know.

It's hard to, Luzia. This isn't the stuff someone your age would say, especially you!

That Ashina lady was right.

I have to protect you, Sombie.

killing yourself.

Sombria, whatever is making you depressed, tell me!

I want to make you happier!

You're freaking me out, Luzia!

I-I'm just scared, Sombie!

I'm scared that I might lose you!

I always never go through with it!

Sometimes, we do go through it...
Sometimes we do go through with it...
but I know I can't stop you...

even though I tried to.

I know this is not my choice...

it's yours.

but I will always be there for you, even if I'm not around.

We still have a shot to break this loop!

But you need to trust me...

please, Sombie.

Ok, I trust you.

I think you're right.

There's one thing though.
There's one thing, though.
Whatever happens just promise me something.
Whatever happens, just promise me something.
Just remember that no matter what, you will always be my sister.

It looks pretty old though.
It looks pretty old, though.
*Sigh* I'm so hungry.

Now, how do I-

It must open the gate outside.

Hmm, it needs power.

\"Back up generator located in the basement.\"
\"Backup generator located in the basement.\"
\"Access the basement via elevator.\"

I can hear laughing?

Abandoned Tunnel

Hmph! Fine!

I have friends y'know!
I have friends, y'know!
Trains haven't come through this subway for years!

Maybe, I don't know.

So, you're a ghost huh?
So you're a ghost, huh?
I'm just a dead, little, girl!
I'm just a dead little girl!
My name is Luzia, I think.

Luzia?

You're the witch!

I'm not a witch!

Am I?

Thanks to you, we're all stuck in this subway!

I'm not the witch!

a little girl?

All of us ghosts know who you are!

You can't lie to me!

Does everyone hate me?

Because you left us all to die in this god forsaken subway!
Because you left us all to die in this godforsaken subway!
All because of your stupid loop!

I couldn't sleep so I went to find Sombria.
I couldn't sleep, so I went to find Sombria.
She comes here when she's-

Are you going to trap her down here too?!
Are you going to trap her down here, too?!
Ha!

No, not Sombie.

You created this place to trap her and all of us here!

So we all can leave!

I-I can't, though.

I CAN'T MOVE ON! AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU!

*Sigh* Look, we all have to make choices that we don't like.

What would happen if she died?

This loop thingy of yours would be broken.

Wait, that's how I break the loop? All she said was to go home-

You owe us!

This is Sombria's home! So send her there!

what's it gonna be? Witch!

Good! We finally made some progress!

Yes, we all will...

including my sister.

W-Wait?! What do you-

I don't know if I am one who has caused all this...
I don't know if I am the one who has caused all this...
but I do know, that I am the one to end it.
but I do know that I am the one to end it.
there is another.

I just know there is.

Verd-

Before I go...

Sombria found her.

I-I thought I lost her...

she fell onto the tracks...

I-I fell, onto the tracks.

We're just like you, y'know?

The old lady was wrong about you.

Old lady?

She talks about the story of the red witch all the time.
She talks about the story of the Red Witch all the time.
But she never mentioned you would be so...nice.

She told you I was The Red Witch?

She said \"only The Red Witch can break the loop.\"
She said \"only The Red Witch can break the loop\".
I will break the loop, I promise.

Good luck, Luz-

Well, good luck Luzia!
Well, good luck, Luzia!
You're me?

I am the red witch, Luzia!

I am you!

So, you want to play games?

Fine.

*Sigh* Truth or dare, you've heard of it before, right?

Ok, ok. Truth.

Playing it safe, huh?

Ew! No.

Ok, your turn.

Truth or-

I-I don't know-

GO KILL YOURSELF!

Truth.

Am I really the red witch?
Am I really the Red Witch?
How do I end the loop?

Kill the one you created it.
Kill the one who created it.
TRUTH!

And who is that?

Dare.

Wait! I need to know-

I said, dare.

J-Just...

end me, please...

for Sombria.

Sombie has suffered enough and it's all because of me.
Sombie has suffered enough, and it's all because of me.
Ever since I was little all I ever did was get in her way, interrupt her life.
Ever since I was little, all I ever did was get in her way, interrupt her life.
Go home.

Just go, now!

a debt repaid.

Don't mess this up, Luzia...

a lot of lives are at steak.
a lot of lives are at stake.
Yes, we did...

And now we can stop this cursed loop and bring you back to normal!

I-I hope so.

I feel great! Just like pickles and beans!

O-Oh I am...

are you ok? You seem, different.
are you ok? You seem...different.
I've always been like this?

You seem, more child like.
You seem more childlike.
N-No no, I didn't mean it like tha-

You look like a giant freak!

Maybe, I am just a freak after all.
Maybe I am just a freak after all.
That's right! R-Run!

Ugh! My head!

It's the butcher's knife?
It's The Butcher's knife?
Good luck kid! We're all countin' on ya!
Good luck, kid! We're all countin' on ya!
Heh, he trusts me with knives now?

Y-Yeah, a little.

Once you're done up there I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

Something wrong, Luzia?

I-I'm fine, I think.

If you say so, my dear.

I just want to say thanks...

for helping me understand Sombria.

Oh! You're very welcome, my dear.

KillYoko

You can ask me anything, my dear.

Why did you do it?

D-Do what?

Let your daughters go.

Luzia, you shouldn't be putting your nose into-

You lied to them, told them that everything was gonna be ok...

but it wasn't, was it?

You turned the other cheek!

How dare you! You little pest!

YOU TOOK THEM AWAY FROM ME!

BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD FOR NOTHING WITC-
BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING WITC-
ENOUGH OF YOUR GAMES!

This isn't a game.

BAH! TRUTH!

Do you still blame lil ol' me for your daughters?

YES! I BLAME YOU-

Then why didn't you stop them?

They asked you for help...

and what did you tell them?

I told them to ignore that man! He was nothing but trouble!

I don't care if they both liked him, you didn't have to take their lives away!

I didn't, you did.

You told them they were foolish, that men only use them to get what they want.

You lied to them.

You forced them to stay home, to cook and clean...

while you courted with the very same man they liked.
while you courted the very same man they liked.
T-THAT'S NOT TRUE!

H-HOW DARE YOU ACUSE ME OF SUCH-

*Sniff* *Softly crying*

I dare you...

to die.

For all the lives you have ruined...

may you find piece, old hag.

I really could just go back to bed.

I've missed you so much!

I feel...

so...sleepy...

I can't keep my eyes open...

I can't take it anymore...

It's mom's lucky screwdriver.
It's Mom's lucky screwdriver.

Can you save her, Sombria?

I-I have to...

Besides, she's my little sister.

I know you can get a better one! There's still time, a chance.

I love you, big sis.
I love you, Big Sis.
And I love you too, y'little knuckle head!

If you tell anyone I said that, I'll kill you.

Hey, listen...

do you wanna go grab some waffles or something at Daisy's?

I thought I'd drop by...

see if you two made it back in one piece.

It took a forever! But we made it!

Serves her right for calling me dumb!

It's not like she appreciated me for helping her get home or anything!

Yeah, maybe I should!

You go tell her how ungrateful she was for you help.

W-Why?

I know who she is!

Lu-Luzia?!

Is that really you!?

I-It's me...

it's-

MOM!

It's so g-good to see your face again, honey.

I-I don't know. I woke up in here, it feels like it's been weeks...

maybe months.

W-Where is Sombria?

She's in her room, probably crying. Serves her right though!

Luzia, I remember the first day I lay eyes on you...

I just knew that you were mine, your sister too.

Both you and Sombria arrived on my doorstep a very long time ago.

I don't know how or why, I guess it was just fate that brought us together.
I don't know how or why. I guess it was just fate that brought us together.
you're not my mom?

I never said that, Luzia.

I will always be your mom.

Sombie too? W-Why, didn't you tell me?

I-I'm sorry, Luzia.

For all of it.

T-That bow of yours...

it's crooked.

It's how I like it.

It suits you.

T-Thanks...

no matter what happens to me.

There's no need to be.

Just stick together...

and you'll be alright.

I haven't been my self lately.

I want to help, I really do...

but this stuff seems so complicated, she never wants my help.

She does, Luzia.

She can't tell you how she feels, but that's what's best about being sisters...

you already know.

Thanks...

mom.
Mom.
It's time to go now. Luzia.

Your sister needs you.

I don't wanna let go.

Mom?

Glad she's ok, I hate it when my sister runs off like that.

It's pretty neat...

it has a swing, so that's something.

I love coming here it helps me...
I love coming here. It helps me...
relax.

Too bad I can't keep coming here anymore.

Because I have to baby sit you now since Mom's been working more.
Because I have to babysit you now since Mom's been working more.
Hopefully now, we can enjoy it together.

When I was in hospital, did you visit me every day?

Yep, I practically lived there. 

Why did you keep coming back?

Pfft! Because you're my sister, silly!

Of course I'd be there for you...

whenever you need me.

There's something that I wanted to ask you.

In my dream you said something about us and mom.
In my dream you said something about us and Mom.
That-

I know, Luzia. It's true.

It doesn't matter where we came from, it's about where we're going that matters.

Huh, I guess you're right.

I love this little family of ours.

So do I. I wouldn't change it for the world.

Who? Oh...

no.

I dumped him way back when you were admitted to hospital.

That guy from the motel seems to fancy you!

Y'know, the one that kept checking out your butt-

Pfft! Why would I?

But you have to promise me that we can stay up late and watch scary movies!

Every night!

I won't tell mom.

Heh.

It's so relaxing.

Otherwise it'd be boring!

Does anything please you, you're majesty?

Yeah, some things.

Like what?

Like stuff.

I dunno, dinosaurs and junk.

Do you think it's weird talking to your older sister?

Well yeah, a little.

You've never been this \"happy\" before.

Yeah, it's a little weird...

but I kinda like it, y'know?

So what's gonna happen now?

Well, I guess I'm gonna have to look after you...

seeing how moms-
Seeing how Mom's-

*Weird*

It'll be okay, though.

I have my big sis looking after me!.

If you disobey me, you're living with aunt Claire!
If you disobey me, you're living with Aunt Claire!
She lives in that creepy lookin' house!

Besides, she'll make me sleep with cousin Mark and he's a weirdo.

That boy's never been the same since uncle Robert left.

Calm down. I'm just kidding.

You better be!
You'd better be!
Wait, how are we gonna pay for stuff?

You don't have a job!

It's fine, Luzia. I've been talking to the owner at Tanto's about some work.

You mean the Chinese restaurant?

Can you get me free fortune cookies?

Ha! We'll see.

I haven't got the job yet, I just spoke with the owner yesterday.

It's gonna be a tough year ahead, Luzia.

But we'll manage.

Well with a big sis like you...

I know we definitely will!

Huh, Luzia. That bow of yours is crooked.

Just the way I like it!

Ha! Never change, Luzia.
